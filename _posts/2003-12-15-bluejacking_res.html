<p>This will probably be my last post about bluejacking, this site is starting to look a bit over-focused on the topic.</p></p>

<p>Over the last week, my girlfriend (who works at a large local school - 2,000 or so pupils) has been wandering around the school with a Bluetooth phone set to discoverable, and named after her. I couldn't think of a more tempting target for a bluejacker than a member of staff. She didn't receive a single message in this time.</p>

<p>However, on the train home from London one evening I was bluejacked; my Powerbook is called Susan (don't ask) and "Bertie" asked me how I was. "Bertie" then stopped receiving responses. We were in transit at the time, but I looked around and couldn't see anyone who looked younger than twentysomething.</p>

<p>My conclusion from this entirely unscientific and anecdotal study? Bluejacking is the province of students and young professionals, not teenagers. It's not a widespread activity by any means: captive audiences on trains provide a distraction for bluejackers. It's not a means of communication, as such: I have yet to hear of a 2-way conversation been carried out over the medium. As such it poses little threat to SMS revenues.
