<p>I received a tattered brown envelope this morning, stuffed full of photos and containing a scratched-out note. I couldn't work out what font it was written in, but the offensive content was obviously the handiwork of <a href="http://www.thewalsh.com/">Mr Walsh</a>. Also included was this lovely photo of us all taken when he was last in Sussex:</p></p>

<p><p align="center"><a href="http://www.tomhume.org/gems/dojo.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.tomhume.org/gems/dojo.html','popup','width=1024,height=768,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://www.tomhume.org/gems/dojo-thumb.jpg" width="200" height="150" border="0" /></a></p></p>
