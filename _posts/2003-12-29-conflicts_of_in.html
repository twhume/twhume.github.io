title: Conflicts of Interest in the SMS Value Chain

<p>Here's a thought which has been bouncing around my head for the last month or so, and which I've mentioned to a few folks: there is a fundamental conflict of interest between companies providing the ability to send and receive text messages on mobile networks (i.e. SMS aggregators), and organisations who want to use text messaging as a communication tool.</p></p>

<p>The SMS aggregators typically maintain expensive direct links into mobile network operators - often into many of them. They'll sell connectivity (i.e. the ability to send or receive text messages) and employ a variety of pricing schemes which typically include one-off set-up charges, monthly rental charges (or enforcing minimum monthly spend on messages), and per-message charges for sending (or sometimes even receiving) text messages. This last scheme typically involves slightly marking up the charges that the mobile network operators apply.</p>

<p>In addition aggregators have pushed the idea of "keywords" onto the industry: they rent a single number, then redirect messages sent to that number to different destinations based on a keyword at the start of each message. So an appointment reminder service might own the keyword "REMIND" on a given phone number, at the same time that a ringtone seller owns the keyword "TONE" on the same number, and when a message comes in that starts with "REMIND" the aggregator can ensure it gets sent to the right destination.</p>

<p>Keywords are a great way of maximising the money aggregators can make out of individual phone numbers; there's no meaningful limit on how many keywords you can have on a single number, and aggregators can therefore make keyword-based products significantly cheaper to run than those that own all communication sent to a given telephone number. I've written <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2003/08/18.html#a1606">before</a> about my views on the disadvantages of keywords; companies like Trinity Mirror have <a href="http://www.nma.co.uk/nmz/story.asp?id=245042">had experiences</a> which seem to back these up - and <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/user/apcro/journalentry?id=325">they're not alone</a>.</p>

<p>Their commercial imperative for aggregators is therefore clear: get as many customers on-board as possible (using keywords to sell cheaper SMS receipt services and make better use of a limited resource of phone numbers), and generate as much message traffic as possible.</p>

<p>But now look at a customers perspective: they use text messaging in everyday life in a very conversational, informal manner. Traditional rules of grammar and spelling go straight out of the window when you're typing a quick note using a phone keypad. Plus every text they send is costing them money, whilst every one they receive is masquerading as a message from a friend and distracting them from whatever they're doing.</p>

<p>Clearly end-users have a different perspective: if they use SMS, they want to do so as quickly as possible - using as few messages as they can to get the job done. They should also expect SMS services to be forgiving: if their mate had to send in the words "FOOTBALL SUBSCRIBE" to get a football alerts service, then "SUBSCRIBE FOOTY" ought to work too. Were the provider of football alerts using a keyword-based service, they wouldn't ever receive the latter message.</p>

<p>So, here's the conflict: whilst it's in the vested interest of aggregators to make SMS services use more messages and to employ keywords, this is exactly the opposite of what makes a service attractive to end-users - and is therefore the opposite of how providers of successful services should behave.</p>

<p>What's the solution? Recognise that an SMS aggregator is not the best party to understand end-user needs and design a workable, appropriate service over text messaging, and talk to someone who is (plug: like <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">us</a>).
