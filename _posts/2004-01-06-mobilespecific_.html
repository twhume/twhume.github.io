<p>From <a href="http://www.mobitopia.com/20040106.html#001236">We need a mobile-oriented top-level domain</a> (on <a href="http://www.mobitopia.com/">Mobitopia</a>):</p></p>

<p>Why is there an assumption that the mass market of mobile users want to know about URLs, or where the services they access reside?</p>

<p>Do cable TV viewers care what frequencies are used to distribute different channels? Do satellite users care which satellite is used to broadcast their favourite channels? Of course not.</p>

<p>Decent operator portals which categorise and impose editorial values to list the most popular web services will address a large proportion of needs from end-users. Decent search engines or schemes like TinyURL or even Bango can help alleviate the pain of typing in URLs. Munging DNS to fit the UI requirements of a specific platform seems like a short-term and rather selfish strategy to me.</p>

<p>The needs of yer average Mobitopia reader (myself included) are very different from the needs of the population at large and are not representative - in the same way that the automobile requirements of mechanics or the music requirements of DJs differ from the requirements of the population as a whole.
