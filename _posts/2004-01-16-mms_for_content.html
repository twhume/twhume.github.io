<p>From "<a href="http://mmsmemo.blogspot.com/2004_01_11_mmsmemo_archive.html#107425389898662988">What about MMS Voicemail?</a>" on <a href="blogspot">MMSMemo</a>:</p></p>

<p>In general, the idea of using MMS to deliver content other than photos hasn't been explored fully yet (though I know that <a href="http://www.mobileentropy.com/">Robert</a> has had some ideas here): audio clips (match reports, extracts from books, music, weather reports) and lengthy pieces of text just aren't deemed as zappy as pictures, I guess...</p>
