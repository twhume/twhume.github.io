<p>I am torn.</p></p>

<p>On the one hand, <a href="http://www.itagg.com/">these guys</a> sponsored the absolutely excellent Swedish Beers networking event which I (too briefly) attended this evening.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I have a whirling firepit of rage hammering around my brain-n-bottle when I read about the value of "mobile domain names". They're keywords for SMS services - a topic I've dealt with a <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/archives/000017.html">couple</a> of times <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2003/08/18.html#a1606">before</a>. Keywords are a bad thing from a usability perspective, and using them results in a significant loss of traffic to SMS services: there's a clear commercial imperative for avoiding them.</p>

<p>So to read about this, <a href="http://mybango.net/affiliate/default.asp">Bango-number</a> style attempt to package up arbitrary words or numbers and equate them with domain names (presumably so as to tie in with dotcom-goldrush ideas of the value inherent in pie-fucking.co.uk or similar) was particularly annoying. I thought we'd left this kind of crap behind us.</p>

<p>(With apologies to the chaps at iTagg who bought me a coke and a bottle of pear cider this evening - sorry guys, but I really don't think this stuff cuts the mustard).
