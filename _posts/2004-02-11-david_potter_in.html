<p><a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> points to <a href="http://www.kewney.com/articles/040209-psion.html">this interview with David Potter</a>, on the subject of Nokias acquisition of Psion. My favourite quote:</p></p>

<p><blockquote><i>"In a year's time, in any case, all phones will be, essentially, "smart" and it will be a marketing decision, not a technology issue, about how much of that smartness is visible to the user."</i></blockquote>
