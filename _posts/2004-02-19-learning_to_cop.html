<p>I went to see <a href="http://www.mtcp.co.uk/">Mark Thomas</a> play at the <a href="http://www.komedia.co.uk/">Komedia</a> last night, along with Dr Dan, Ju, Ken, NewTom, Steve and <a href="http://www.davephelan.org/">DavePh</a>. He was absolutely ace; most of the gig consisted of stories from various protests  like <a href="http://www.dsei.co.uk/">DSEI</a> in London ("if someone phones in and says there's a bomb in the building, is that a hoax?") and <a href="http://cndyorks.gn.apc.org/mhs/">Menwith Hill</a>), with a screed against Coca Cola taking up much of the second half.</p></p>

<p>I'd never seen him play live before, but will definitely make an effort to do so again. Well worth it, even if I did walk away with a slight feeling of shame that I don't think and do more about this sort of stuff...</p>
