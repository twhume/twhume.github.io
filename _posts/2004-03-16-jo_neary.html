<p>At last, the excellent Jo Neary has some sort of <a href="http://www.komediaentertainment.com/acts_details.php?id=4">interweb place</a> where you can go and see a single solitary clip of her stuff in PostageStampVision... </p></p>

<p>"<i>Somewhere between a Radio 4 play and sitting next to the mad woman on the bus</i>", indeed.</p>

<p>Update: Duh. Since I last looked she appears to have gotten <a href="http://joneary.co.uk/">her own site</a> too...
