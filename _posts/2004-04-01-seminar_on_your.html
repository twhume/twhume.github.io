<p>A now-rare Aikido-related post for the 2 people who read this blog and might be interested in it...</p></p>

<p>We're fortunate to be having <a href="http://www.takemusu.co.uk/Gallery/Seminar/Matthew%20Hill/Figsbury%20Ring/">Matthew Hill Sensei</a> visiting Brighton towards the end of May for a 1-day seminar. There's a flyer with full contact details etc. <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/gems/Seminar.pdf">here</a> if you're interested.</p>
