<p>MMO2 have <a href="http://www.unstrung.com/document.asp?doc_id=51038&site=unstrung">shut down</a> the 3G network which ran on the Isle of Man (in conjunction with Manx Telecom).</p></p>

<p>I'm not quite sure why they've done this (and despite the fact that <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">Future Platforms</a> provided a set of 3G healthcare services, this press story is the first I've heard about it). An O2 spokesman says "<i>it was never intended to be a commercial service</i>", which directly contradicts <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1184724.stm">what was said</a> when the service launched:</p>

<p><blockquote>"<i>Mr Briers says Manx Telecom's service is intended to be commercially successful rather than merely a chance for BT to try out the technology.</i>"</blockquote></p>

<p>It's interesting that, having set up the not-quite-first 3G network in the world with support from NEC and Siemens, MMO2 have decided to go with Nokia and Nortel for their future European 3G services.
