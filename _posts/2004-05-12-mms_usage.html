<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3704443.stm">This story</a> at the BBC talks about a recent survey into MMS usage. It's presented in a fairly negative light: the writer concentrates on how little this stuff is getting used, but I actually found it quite positive.</p></p>

<p><blockquote><i>"83% have never sent an MMS<br>
45% do not have compatible mobiles<br>
17% did not know how to send a message<br>
78% of MMS users have sent pictures of friends or family<br>
27% had sent music clips<br>
14% had sent sports clips"</i></blockquote></p>

<p>This is fantastic: looking at this survey another way, 17% of the population have used MMS, well over half have mobiles which can handle it today, and 83% know how to send a message.</p>

<p>Given that MMS is a completely new sort of service (try not to look at it as "SMS with pictures", it's positioned, priced and used in a completely different way), and that it requires users to have relatively recently (<2 years old) kit to work, I think this is excellent news.
