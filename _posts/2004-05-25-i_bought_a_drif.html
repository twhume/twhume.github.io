<p>I bought a Drifter (delicious chewy chocolatey goodness for anyone who's not encountered it - just add a can of Dr Pepper for instant breakfast) the other day, and noticed one of the old "text in to win" promotions advertised on the side of the packet.</p></p>

<p>What caught my eye was that the promotion didn't even mention text messaging until you got to the small print - i.e. this stuff has reached the lovely point where it can be taken for granted that it uses texting. That struck me as a good thing, just as it was a good thing when people stopped being all proud that they had a web site (or fax machine, or telegraph) and started thinking about what they could usefully do with the darn thing...
