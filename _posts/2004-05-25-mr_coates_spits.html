<p>Mr Coates <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2004/05/better_design_through_simplicity.shtml">spits out</a> some pointers on improving design. He really should write that stuff up some time.</p></p>

<p>Number 4 is particularly interesting to me: much of the work we've been doing this year has been on prototypes or proof-of-concepts, and the value of having something in the palm of your hand, which you can ask real people (as opposed to industry folk) to interact with, makes it well worth doing.... particularly for mobile, I feel, where it's difficult to visualise exactly how an application will "feel".
