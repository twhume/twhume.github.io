<p>I'd missed <a href="http://news.ft.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=FT.com/StoryFT/FullStory&c=StoryFT&cid=1084907871628">this story</a>, about DoCoMo talking to UK operators in an attempt to try and get I-mode into the UK.</p></p>

<p>I don't understand why 3 haven't launched it; a few years back I remember being told by someone reasonably senior in the company that they planned to offer a "dual approach" of both WAP and I-mode, but the I-mode side of things seems to have fallen by the wayside... given how much their adoption of I-mode might have placated one of their <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/05/27/ntt_docomo_sells_3_stake/">major creditors</a>, it seems like a strange decision.</p>

<p>...and as this article says, all the UK operators have made heavy committments to their own portals: OrangeWorld is a group-wide effort (which seems to have much of the R&D <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/10/30/welcome_to_orange_world/">done in the UK</a>), as is T-Zones... and I can't see Vodafone Live changing to adopt I-mode. So I guess this leaves O2 as the most likely adopter of I-mode... <b>update</b> which The Register <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/05/28/docomo_seeks_uk_partner/">seems to think</a>, too...</p>
