<p>Nokia have announced something called "<a href="http://www.mobile-weblog.com/archives/cool_new_nokia_feature.html">Wave Messaging</a>".</p></p>

<p>Is it me, or is there a movement towards giving digital media more of a foothold in the real world? Thinks like this development, snap-on covers for handsets, Donkey Konga (using a drum to beat along to on-screen rhythms), Wario Ware (a fantastically addictive Gamecube title which consists of hundreds of 3-second "minigames" and encourages players to distract each other) seem to all be heading in the same direction...
