<p>Hmm. So people <a href="http://www.mobilepipeline.com/21401490">want wireless headsets, but not Bluetooth</a>.</p></p>

<p>Of course, this survey is rubbish. If you ask people what they want in these terms, and give them the choice of a beneficial feature and the technology which enables that feature, of course they'll choose the former. It's about as fair as asking people "Would you like to make phone calls from anywhere, or have access to a GSM network via a battery-powered handheld device?"</p>

<p>All this survey does is validate the approach that the mobile industry has been taking: of hiding the technology and selling the benefits. We in the industry might know and care about Bluetooth - but we're freaks. Normal people don't. This study indicates that normal people want to use the technology, but they just don't care about it; and there's nothing wrong with that.
