<p>Russell <a href="http://www.mobile-weblog.com/archives/cheaper_calling.html">posts</a> about a future where handsets patch in to whatever networks are available - of different types. So that you might move from Vodafone, to a local community Wi-Fi network, and so on.</p></p>

<p>Things that I've noted about this:</p>

<p>1. Handsets already do this. When I roam to Spain, my phone switches between the various networks which are out there that have roaming agreements with Orange.</p>

<p>2. How will small-scale networks bill their customers?</p>

<p>3. How will these networks provide any accountability or quality of service?
