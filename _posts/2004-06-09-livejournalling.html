<p>I now have a <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/twhume/">Livejournal</a>. Probably won't do an awful lot with it - I was motivated to join (a) so I can comment on other peoples LJs with my real name, or at least a consistent identity, (b) to read restricted LJ posts and (c) as an experiment regarding writing tools (as per <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/archives/000317.html">previous</a> <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/archives/000001.html">posts</a>)</p>
