<p>Irrespective of whether you agree with John Reids opinions (or dangerous and patronising pronouncements, depending on your pov) on <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3789591.stm">smoking and the freedom to do it</a>, isn't it inappropriate for the health secretary to make such a public statement? What next - the home secretary defending crime as a lifestyle choice that brings joy to millions?</p>
