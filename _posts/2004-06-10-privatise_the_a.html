<p>I'm rather middle class. But is it just me, or do other people find the assumption that "if you don't have money, there's nothing for you to do", a bit weird? It seems to be the cornerstone of <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/publicservices/story/0,11032,1235924,00.html?=rss">John Reids defence</a></p></p>

<p>When I look at the spectrum of people I know - from those on the dole to those in high-paid jobs - there are individuals at each end of the spectrum who do little with their time, and there are individuals who do an awful lot.</p>
