<p>I had a great weekend.</p></p>

<p>On Friday night, I wandered down to the small twitten joining Ship Street and Middle Street; right in the heart of Brighton's new media zone (i.e. near the <a href="http://www.mediacentre.org/">Media Centre</a>), <a href="http://www.gooby.org/">Jay</a> and I affectionately christened it "Tramp Piss Alley" when looking at office space down there.</p>

<p>And by coincidence, the building we looked at back in 2001 is now <a href="http://www.cvsectorforum.org.uk/org/membersdet.asp?orgid=821">The Bodhi Garden Centre</a>, a refuge for all sorts of meditation, yoga and related groups. Wandering down there a few weeks back, I noticed a poster advertising <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/zen/faq.html">zazen</a> there on Friday evenings.</p>

<p>I've never done any meditation type stuff before, but <a href="http://www.airenjuku.org/senseis.html">Tom and Maria</a> have often talked fondly of the time they spent doing it when they lived in London, so I've been curious to learn a bit more. And I *think* I'm right in saying it's one of those things which you're best off just doing, rather than trying to read about.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I turned up at 8 on Friday and said hi to the other guys there. It turns out that they're mostly aikido folks too, who run a <a href="http://happyaikido.com/links/links1a.html">dojo</a> in the centre of town. It was also a bit of a special occasion - a zen nun was there conducting (or whatever the verb is) the evening. I was given a few minutes instruction into etiquette (very Japanese; lots of bowing, sitting in half-lotus, turning exact right-angles when walking) then we sat down.</p>

<p>The bulk of the practice was 20 or 25-minute sessions of sitting, cushion under my arse, keeping my back straight, chin tucked in, hands in a mundra, staring  downwards 45 degrees at a screen. I tried (as instructed) to not think of anything in particular, but my mind was all over the shop. I've got a bit of a cough at the moment, which I spent a good 10 minutes trying to choke back. Lots of time spent adjusting my posture too - looking downwards seemed to drag my head forward and down, leaving me less then upright.</p>

<p>After the first session, we stood up and walked in circles for a little bit - very slowly, one breath per footstep - then sat down and stared at the wall for a bit more; then turned around and did a bit of chanting (some of which I recognised from chanting we've done in misogi before now).</p>

<p>After saying thankyous, I wandered off to the pub (conveniently nearby), and reaslised that I felt absolutely great. I don't know whether it was the novelty value of it all, just spending an hour being quiet, or what... but I think I'm going to wander back this week and give it another go.</p>

<p>After that virtuous start, the weekend proceeded well: Friday night in the pub with les freres Hoskeres, Saturday over to New^H^H^HBrokenTom's for his birthday bbq and then on to the pub to say goodbye to Rosie, who's moving to London. Sunday I went out running (I ought to, seeing as I'm notionally training for a half-marathon later this year) and then aikido in the evening,  before getting home to watch England pull off a classically English performance...</p>

<p>Oooh and my planned trip to Japan next year seems to be taking a more defined shape: the idea was to train at <a href="http://www.aikikai.or.jp/Eng/">Hombu dojo</a> or out in <a href="http://www.aikikai.or.jp/Eng/ibaraki/top.htm">Iwama</a> (where apparently Hombu are running, or due to be running an uchi-deshi scheme) for a couple of weeks, then spend a few days slumming around with <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/wsogmm">Julie</a>... as it turns out, Tom and Maria are keen to go out around that time too, so we may well have a bit of a posse...
