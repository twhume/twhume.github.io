<p>I'm still not convinced by this, but I was chatting to <a href="http://www.ebgs.co.uk/band/index.php">Mix Master El Bastardos Rock Star</a> about it yesterday and he made a couple of points:</p></p>

<p><blockquote>"<i>...the thing is that BT enables you
to have a nice level of anonymity and be playful before committing
yourself. I think this is what people like... also the immediacy of it
(i.e. the fact that it's someone nearby) probably gives somewhat of a
kick.</i>"</blockquote></p>

<p>The idea of "playfulness" and its important in this sort of communication isn't something that had occurred to me. Mind you, then he said:</p>

<p><blockquote>"<i>I do think it would be quite nice though if your personality could be tattooed on your forehead as a bar code (as you once aspired to). I
think we should then be given optical scanners and scan each other to
see if we are interesting. That would be cool.</i>"</blockquote>
