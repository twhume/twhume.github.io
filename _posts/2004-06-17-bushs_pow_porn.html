<blockquote>"<i>I want to take a long, hard  look at Bush's sexuality. Because The Photos are Bush's porn.  Oh, he says they "disgust" him. Of course, they do.  Listen, I'm a sex therapist. Many of my clients will say something  disgusts them at first, only to confess a few sessions later  that it really turns them on.</p>

<p>Shortly after the censorship  dam burst and The Photos were released publicly, Bush issued  his first attempt at apologizing: "I share a deep disgust  that those prisoners were treated the way they were treated."  He coughed up the words like a chicken bone, or that pretzel  he swallowed and almost choked on. And he looked like a shifty-eyed  boy caught by his mama, his schoolteacher and the whole neighborhood  with his political pants down, way down around his ankles, exposing  his severe shortcomings for all the world to revile.</p>

<p>Notice that he started to say  how "those prisoners" were "treated." But  then, he couldn't say it. After all, it might have given him  an erection. Which would not help his reelection.</i>"</blockquote></p>
