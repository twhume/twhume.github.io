<p>From "<a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1007881.html">Nokia: Innovate on the Inside</a>" at <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/">Russell Beattie</a>:</p></p>

<p>"Are there any S60 handsets that are S40 sized?</p>

<p>I moved to a 6230 recently, but had been on a 6100 for a few months before that - and really liked the form factor. It didn't fill my pocket or feel bulky like my old 7650/3650, it felt like a *phone*.</p>

<p>6230 does everything I want and more (J2ME/BT/radio/WAP/etc), screen size is adequate (more would be nicer but it's not a killer), it's *responsive*, and stats I see for WAP traffic to some services we run indicates that S40 handsets generate 2x the traffic of S60...</p>

<p>I don't get S40-bashing - it's certainly not as featureful and I can see how some users might really need to have 3rd party native apps on their phone... but for most people out there, S40 handsets are more obviously phones (and thus less intimidating) whilst retaining a load of new mBoom goodness :)"</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>"I see what you mean, but I think that Series 40 appeals to lots of people precisely because it's more familiar and phone-like, and less feature-ful. Most of my friends from outside the mobile/new media industries have Nokias; they've all gone for 7210s and the like. For most of them it's their first camera-phone - having a camera is itself a novelty and quite exciting (whilst for us it's old hat).</p>

<p>I see S40 as a mid-step between old-style voice+sms only handsets and future mobile data... and as such reckon it's important that S40 not be too flashy. Gyrating icons might look pretty, but they'll put some people off. The S40 interface is an evolution of previous Nokia UIs, and can be traced back quite a long way to early handsets; so it has some familiarity to anyone who's owned a Nokia handset before.</p>

<p>S60 is great for power users, and spreading from the top down. But motivating the majority of mobile subscribers to get using data services won't be achieved by persuading them to completely change their ideas of what a phone is... it'll be done by teasing them along the way, using more familiar devices (for now)"
