<p><a href="http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/004241.htm">Recruitment firms like discreet texting</a> - yes they do! When <a href="http://www.gooby.org/">Jay</a> and I set up <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">FP</a>, our girlfriends both worked at recruitment agencies - getting hold of prospects privately is really important for them.</p></p>

<p>But to state the obvious more generally: mobiles are personal. They're owned by (or at least used near-exclusively by) individuals. Unlike email, which relies on being in a fixed location (at home or in the office) and kit which you're less likely to own (the office PC, their exchange server) and control, your mobile is YOU.
