<p>I don't agree with the premise of <a href="http://thegareth.net/home/words/drm">this article</a>, "How I learned to love the devil, Or at least accept why Digital Rights Management has a role". DRM forces me to think about the interests of the large companies who sell me media a little too much for my liking, just so these companies can "send a message" that Piracy Is Wrong...</p></p>

<p>...but it's well-written, has some interesting points about the enforcement of ludicrous existing rights arrangements, and details about the BBC IMPS project.</p>

<p>I agree Gareths point about people wanting an easy life; my suggestion would be to make the process of purchasing music legally so simple and cheap that piracy becomes pointless...</p>

<p><blockquote><i>"DRM is only as flawed as the business landscape it supports</i>"</blockquote></p>

<p>Fair enough, but rather than building on such a flawed landscape, why not put effort into fixing the business side of things?
