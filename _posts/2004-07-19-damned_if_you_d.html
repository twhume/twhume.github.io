<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,1264629,00.html?=rss">REPORT DAMNS POLITICAL BLOGS</a> screams the Guardian:</p></p>

<p><blockquote><i>"In the frequently damning report, the society says political blogging is still in its infancy. While it still has great potential to engage the electorate, the authors say, blogging forms a very minor part of public debate."</i></blockquote></p>

<p>So what the report (which summarises a survey of eight - EIGHT! - people) actually says is: there's not much of it, but it could be great. Hardly "damning".</p>
