<p><a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99996156">Users prefer polite computers</a>, according to this article from the New Scientist.</p></p>

<p>This is something I bang on about when we're talking to our clients about design: that overall tone is important, particularly for mobile phone applications which are:</p>

<p>(a) not perceived as being computers (I overheard a friend of mine this weekend talking about how phones are "practically computers' these days).</p>

<p>(b) used by people who will be frightened or intimidated by technology; despite wishful thinking from some quarters about operators becoming pure data pipes, they perform a valuable function of bringing together complex devices, radio networks, and billing relationships and presenting these in a (reasonably) consumer-friendly way.</p>

<p>Want more convincing? Read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1575860538/tomhume-21">The Media Equation</a>, an excellent book which <a href="http://www.gooby.org/">Jay</a> recommended to me years back and which delves into how people react to machines and computers.
