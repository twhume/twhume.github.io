<p>There's an interesting report from Handango <a href="http://www.handango.com/PressRelease.jsp?siteId=1&CKey=1_PRESSRELEASE_PR071904">here</a>, giving details of the most popular mobile application purchases recently.  It's all very US-focused (and PDA-heavy), but there's some interesting bits in here:</p></p>

<p><ol>
<li> Puzzles make up 40% of the top 10 best selling Java apps (most of which are games).
<li> Only 20% of the top 10 ringtones sold are recently released music; the others are either TV or movie themes. 
<li>The cheapest application category (Games) is the most searched.
<li>Is the average game really sold for $11.16?
</ol>
