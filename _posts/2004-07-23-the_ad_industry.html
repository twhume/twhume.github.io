<p>Lovely quote from <a href="http://www.mobile-weblog.com/archives/interactive_advertising.html">Russell</a>:</p></p>

<p><blockquote>"<i>However I still find it really strange why the advertising industry isn't embracing SMS interactivity - we've been talking about it for 4 years. While I could understand that it was early then, it's been a mainstream medium for at least 2 years now, by anyone's definition.</p>

<p>But then, contrary to popular belief, the ad industry is actually pretty conservative and mostly still worships at the alter of the 30 second TV commercial. Even though this God is no longer answering their prayers anymore and grows increasing deaf as time passes.</i>"</blockquote></p>

<p>We've been running <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/fp/news.jsp?i=43">TextBack</a> for a few artists on EMI this year, which is a step towards bringing this interactivity to traditional media like billboards and print ads...
