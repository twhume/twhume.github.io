<p>Steve Bowbrick has <a href="http://www.themanwhoinventedtheinternet.com/2004/07/student_grant_a.html">posted</a> one of the original proposals for the Lloyds TSB student banking site.</p></p>

<p>If it's the same one I'm thinking of, when I was working for <a href="http://www.gtnetwork.com/">GT</a> we took over the site from Webmedia and maintained it for a bit. It was one of the first bank sites I remember. Well, I say "remember": all that springs to mind is a load of student-oriented info and a camper van motif...
