<p><a href="http://www.gtnetwork.com/">GT</a> are celebrating their 10th birthday in a few days time, prompting <a href="http://home.asparagine.net/blog/index.php?p=44">Pete</a> to go searching for historical records online.</p></p>

<p>I can't find the original job advert that I replied to in August/September 1995, but I know it's out there somewhere...
