<p>Right. Got a busy day today tying up some odds and ends, then I'm off on "holiday" first thing tomorrow - to <a href="http://www.chesteraikido.fsnet.co.uk">Summer School</a> in Chester: 7 days of training and a grading to get through. If we survive that, the plan is for me and Steve to head on to Leeds and go visit <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/wsogmm/">Julie</a> and Johnny. Doubt I'll be posting here for a week or so...</p>
