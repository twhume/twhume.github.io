<p>Devi@FP just showed me this promotion; it's for a drinks company who are running a teaser campaign all around Brighton. Quite fun stuff - you wear the sweatband (and presumably get special offers at a few local drinking holes), and can text in for "further instructions".</p></p>

<p><p align="center"><a href="http://www.tomhume.org/archives/gems/x.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.tomhume.org/archives/gems/x.html','popup','width=480,height=640,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://www.tomhume.org/archives/gems/x-thumb.jpg" width="120" height="160" border="0" /></a></p></p>

<p>I sent one in and received back: "I can neither confirm nor deny your inqury. X"</p>

<p>I presume that at some point in the future I'll receive something else; this feels like a really nicely run campaign. I'm already intrigued by it and it's certainly pushed their new drink (Xant&eacute;) to my attention... good to see small brands being a bit more adventurous...</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: just received a text: "See U Tonight 19.00 at The Tin Drum Dyke Rd".
