<p>I'm off on holiday this evening, heading to <a href="http://www.parga.com/">Parga in Greece</a> for a week of lounging around, chipping away at my pile of reading. Back next weekend, and unlikely to be posting between now and then...</p></p>

<p>Work's been good recently btw. We've just got a fun project confirmed, developing a messaging platform for an existing client of ours. We've spent a lot of time thinking about the needs of such a beast over the last few years, so it's nice to finally get to build the thing - and it's got some really neat stuff in it that I can't go into publicly (yet). Two other top secret projects, both of which will be really fun, very public consumer-facing stuff are also threatening to kick off in the near future, and we've got a few other bits and bobs lurking in the background: redeveloping some Vodafone Live! services, bits of SMS for EMI, and the ongoing mobile gambling project we've been working on for nearly a year now is into the final furlong.</p>

<p>All this, plus a move to a larger office in September/October (upstairs from our current one, still to be shared with <a href="http://www.redheaddesign.com/">Redhead</a> and <a href="http://www.neujuice.com/">Neujuice</a>, but we'll have more space to breathe - and a meeting area at last!), and some other interesting developments that I'll write about when they actually take place...
