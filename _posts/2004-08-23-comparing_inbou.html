<p>From "<a href="http://www.mobile-weblog.com/archives/mms_takes_off.html">MMS Takes off?</a>", at <a href="http://www.mobile-weblog.com/">The Mobile Technology Weblog</a>:</p></p>

<p>"<i>Compared to a response rate for an advertising campaign, 0.25% is certainly poor (from what I know about average rates)... but this isn't really the same thing, is it?</p>

<p>IMHO two better comparisons might be:</p>

<p>How many people go onto the Channel 4 chat-room after watching a given programme?</p>

<p>How many people write into programmes to get information packs by post?</p>

<p>I don't know what the rates for these are, but they seem like a better comparisons: they're calls to action, undertaken at the expense of the viewer, and involve stepping out of the medium currently being accessed (TV) and using another (internet, the written word)...</i>"
