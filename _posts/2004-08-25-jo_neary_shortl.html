<p>Cool. Excellent local comedienne Joanna Neary (who I wrote about <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/archives/000211.html">back here</a>) has been <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/edinburgh2004/story/0,14762,1290681,00.html?=rss">nominated</a> for on the Perrier newcomers shortlist...</p></p>

<p>If you ever get a chance to see one of her shows, GO!
