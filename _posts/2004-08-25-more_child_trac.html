<p>Sorry, it may be a technically great piece of work, but <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/essex/3594424.stm">this</a> is <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/archives/000604.html">more of the same</a>.</p></p>

<p>Karen, who I'm sure is a talented design graduate, talks about how she would run off and get lost in shops herself as a child. It's my understanding that GPS requires line-of-sight to a satellite and therefore won't work indoors... so how would her creation have helped?</p>
