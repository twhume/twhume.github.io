<p>More <a href="http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/4022.asp">fluff</a> about the launch of a mobile-specific domain name, .mp; but I've written about this <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/archives/000204.html">before</a>...</p></p>

<p>I don't get the argument that "there's lots of mobile devices, so we need a special domain name for them". Do we need similar domain names for cars, sheep, or idiots?</p>

<p>Or is it a tool <a href="http://www.sunrise.mp/">from which to hang sales of a mobile CMS</a>?</p>

<p>Still, <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/TLD">what does TBL know</a>, eh?
