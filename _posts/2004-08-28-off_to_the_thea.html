<p>My mum and I wandered up to the <a href="http://www.openairtheatre.org/">Open Air Theatre</a> at Regents Park last night, to go and see a production of Midsummer Nights Dream. My cousin Nol has been part of a company who've put on a few plays there over the summer: Camelot, one of the Henrys, MSD, and so on.</p></p>

<p><p align="center"><a href="http://www.tomhume.org/archives/gems/theatre.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.tomhume.org/archives/gems/theatre.html','popup','width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://www.tomhume.org/archives/gems/theatre-thumb.jpg" width="160" height="120" border="0" /></a></p></p>

<p>It was absolutely ace! I think I've only seen MSD done a couple of times before, and always found it a little dull (particularly the last section after all the fairy mischief has been put right and the play-with-a-play is put on). But this time round, it was genuinely amusing - perhaps in part to the presence of <a href="http://www.memorabletv.com/halloffame/russabbott.htm">Russ Abbott</a>, who I hadn't seen since watching his TV show in the 80s.</p>

<p>But to be fair, all the cast were great... though watching Nol lumber around the stage shrieking in a bald wig and sailors outfit was obviously a high point for me...
