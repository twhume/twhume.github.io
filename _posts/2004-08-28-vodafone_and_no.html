<p>More details have <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/1,6566,040,00.html?fsrParam=2-3-/main.html&fileID=5755">been released</a> here about the <a href="http://www.mobilepipeline.com/35100045">Vodafone/Nokia alliance</a> for improving the portability of J2ME products.</p></p>

<p>It's pretty fluffy: they're basically saying "we'll consolidate the variety that exists today in J2ME into common APIs, arranged into a couple of different classes of devices". Hmm, where have we seen this before? Series 40/60/etc. families of device.</p>

<p>If Vodafone get behind this it'll be a really good thing: the worlds largest mobile network operator collaborating with the worlds largest handset vendor to bring a bit of regulation to new handsets. Unfortunately, the more regulation you have, the more a zappy new handset from one of the other manufacturers is going to stand out... and there's no guarantee that VF and Nokia will really commit to this relationship anyway.
