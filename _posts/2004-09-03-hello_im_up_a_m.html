<p>With appalling timing, I'm off on holiday again this week. Last time this year, promise. And I am never taking 3 weeks off over the summer again. Not even during August, when "everything is always really quiet" - urk.</p></p>

<p>Going to do the 3 peaks with my dad and a friend of his - Snowdon, Scarfell Pike, and then Ben Nevis. Should get some nice photos.
