<p>Wow - I've just seen a #mobitopia post concerning a <a href="http://www.ses.fi/en/film.asp?id=615">film being made</a> about Riot-E. I remember these guys well, we met them when we first set up <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">Future Platforms</a> and they were scouting around for game developer partners. At the time they were very focused on SMS content, but from what I remember they spent oodles of cash on licensing huge film properties (e.g. Bridget Jones) then doing very little of any real worth with the licenses. I was quite fond of the broken English which they used to describe themselves - their slogan was something like "we don't write games. we create riots"...</p></p>

<p>I'd love to see the film - just hope it gets a UK release. Wonder if we'll see any familiar faces amidst the debauchery?
