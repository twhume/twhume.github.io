<p>Well, we've arrived; after about 6 hours on the road, we rolled up at the B&B in Betws-y-coed at 6:15 and settled in. I've not been here for a couple of years now - for a while a group of us got into a routine of camping around Llanberis once or twice a year (usually in the winter), but we've fallen out of the habit.</p></p>

<p>Betws-y is quite unashamedly aimed at tourists, and the streets are full of people wandering about even now; but it's beautiful, nestled in a valley bisected by a small stream (which I can hear from my bedroom window as I write).</p>

<p>I'm absolutely shattered, mainly on account of heading out to Hard South at the Honey Club for Ju's birthday celebrations with the usual suspects (Span/Jude/Emm/Jen/Steve/Hosker x 3) last night and finishing at around 6am when the cider finally ran out. Spent most of the car journey lurching in and out of the Land of Nod.</p>

<p>And first thing tomorrow - Snowdon!
