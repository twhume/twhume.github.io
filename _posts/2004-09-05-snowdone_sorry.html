<p>Today has been beautiful - easily the best weather that I've ever seen in Wales. We got up early (well... 8ish), breakfasted in the dining room of the B&B we're staying at, then drove off to Snowdon. After finding the car park by the starting point we were hoping to use already full, we turned around and managed to find an alternative lay-by, at the start of the Watkins path up the mountain.</p></p>

<p>I've never done this one before, and it's significantly longer than the others I know (the Pyg track, Miners track and Grib Goch - sp?), mainly because you start much lower down and climb the full way up. But the weather made this very pleasant, and we meandered up past brooks and streams, until the last 45 minutes which was much more of a scramble over rocks than a walk. </p>

<p>The top of Snowdon is always a bit disappointing: crowded with people who've come up on the train to have their lunch and look out, and the caf&eacute; is a bit surreal. But the view is still good. We sat down with sandwiches for a few minutes, texted a few people (of course), and endured harrassment from a suspiciously round and rather demanding sheep...</p>

<p>...and then down, along the ridge. And then up the ridge again (legs complaining by now). And then down again, rather steeply across a field laden in heather, and back down to the track which brought us up, and back to the car.</p>

<p>Oh, and despite managing to survive a week in Greece in ridiculous temperatures without getting a tan, one September day out in Wales and I'm already sunburnt...
