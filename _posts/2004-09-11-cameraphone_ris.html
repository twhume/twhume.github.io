<p>Can someone explain to me why <a href="http://wireless.weblogsinc.com/entry/0039360825968015/">businesses might want employees to leave cameraphones at home</a>?</p></p>

<p>I mean- WHY? What can they do with cameraphones that is so damaging? This article talks about "damaging spy shots that can reveal a companies trade secrets" - but is this really a risk? Only if these things are on the one hand not secret enough for someone to bother smuggling in a proper camera and doing the industrial espionage thing properly, yet at the same time secret enough to require protection?</p>

<p>What stops an employee just seeing something, remembering it, and telling the competition about it? Is the risk here that cameraphones might offer proof - or put another way, that what your employees might say is deniable until they have photos?</p>

<p>If you have an employee who wants to take your secrets to the competition, what additional danger does a cameraphone pose?
