<p>Well Code Camp is wrapping up, so not too much to report.  Last night they threw us a bit of a party.  More drinks and food than most people knew what to do with, a BBC DJ, and a couple of slight of hand magicians that were really good; bent spoons, and 50 pound notes popping out of thin air.   The folks at Orange have really put quite a bit of effort in organising this event.  Its made for quite an enjoyable time.  </p>

<p>This morning I was up at 8:00 to see a presentation on Microsoft .Net for mobile devices.  Its quite a slick system they have built with .Net, the same classes for windows work on mobiles.  Its sort of a Java like model.  Not suitable for everything by for pocket pc development its probably the way to go.</p>

<p>Well thats pretty much it for Code Camp.  Just the closing ceremonies to come.</p>
