<p><a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">We're</a> going to be providing some funky mobile services for <a href="http://www.wiredsussex.com/events/0410/dscape04.asp">this event</a>, being run by local digital cluster bods <a href="http://www.wiredsussex.com/">Wired Sussex</a> at the end of October.</p></p>

<p>Talking through the line-up for the night, it sounds like <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/mediastudies/profile119032.html">Dr Michael Bull</a> might be speaking; I'm really looking forward to hearing him if so, having read some interesting articles about his <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,63068,00.html">research</a> into <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,62396,00.html">iPod users</a>.</p>
