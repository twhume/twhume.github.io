<p>T-Mobile are <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/09/15/t-mobile_music_phone/">launching a new handset</a> blatantly designed to blur the line between phone and music player. How good a job it'll do isn't clear, particularly given the fairly measly on-board storage, but it reminds me of what I saw when I went out Japan in August 2000: a massive variety of form factors for mobile devices, seemingly targeted at loads of niches.</p></p>

<p>At the time, the Japanese operators seemed much more inclined than their European counterparts to experiment with form factors: maybe we're starting to see that attitude drift towards Europe?</p>

<p>On a related note, I *really* need to get out to Japan again.
