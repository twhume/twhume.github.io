<p>I liked <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/mobile/articles/device_content.html">this article</a> from the Macromedia site. Firstly because it shows that they understand that mobile isn't just "web stuff but smaller":</p></p>

<p><blockquote><I>"Even if you are a fourth level grand dark wizard of ActionScript, there&rsquo;s more to creating Macromedia Flash applications for devices than simply resizing the content."</i></blockquote></p>

<p>...and also because the business advice at the end seems very sensible, and isn't in any way Flash-specific.
