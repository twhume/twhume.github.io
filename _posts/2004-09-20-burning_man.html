<p>Dr Dan came round last night with his video diary of <a href="http://www.burningman.com/">Burning Man</a>, and we sat there gaping at the sights for about 90 minutes whilst he narrated us through the whole journey. That, combined with the galleries that <a href="http://gallery.gooby.org/view_album.php?set_albumName=BurningMan04">Jay</a> and <a href="http://stack.dnsalias.net/~dphelan/2004-09-15/">Dave</a> have put online of all their photos, have persuaded me that next year will be The Year.</p></p>

<p>It looks like having a lot of the spirit Glastonbury old-timers tell me that festival had and lost, years before I started going...
