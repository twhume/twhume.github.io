<p>A album by 16 high-profile artists <a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/09/21/wired_creative_commons_compilation_cd.html">is released for free</a>; supporting material from the making of Outfoxed is <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,65024,00.html">put out</a> using BitTorrent; and Wired report on <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,64828,00.html">free content that people are paying for</a>.</p></p>

<p>What's the mobile angle? Convenience is worth money. An example: the SMS service on the <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/">National Rail</a> site, which will text you the details of a journey you've examined.</p>

<p>It's easily argued against: I look up these details when I'm sitting at my desk with pen and paper within easy reach, and the information isn't difficult to remember - "so who's going to pay for that?". But it's so damn convenient to have the details of my journey in my pocket all the time that I now regularly pay a 25p pittance...</p>

<p>Similarly, look at content services. I can use Yellow Pages to look up a restaurants details, or I can pay 25p to do it on Vodafone Live ... whenever and wherever I am. In many cases, <b>mobility in itself adds value</b>.
