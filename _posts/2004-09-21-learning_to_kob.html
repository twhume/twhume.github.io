<p>Hmm, just finished giving a brief talk for a <a href="http://www.sussexenterprise.co.uk/">Sussex Enterprise</a> event held at the lovely <a href="http://www.kobauk.com/">Koba</a> (site design: <a href="http://www.neujuice.com/">Neujuice</a>), on PDAs and smartphones for small businesses.</p></p>

<p>It felt weird. I've not done any public speaking for ages, and whilst I was nervous as hell before-hand I kind-of ended up enjoying it. I guess that's a good sign, but I spotted my usual tendency to talkfasterandfasterasthingswenton popping up, and ended up throwing a load of cack in there (bears? snakes? what was that all about??). I wish I'd prepared more, yet less formally, in retrospect: until 5pm this afternoon I had a *very* corporate PowerPoint indeed. So anyway, I need to do more of this - any offers?</p>

<p>Still, really nice to see a few of the local new meeja faces there (<a href="http://www.adactio.com/">Jeremy</a>, <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/">Richard</a>, <a href="http://www.hirschworks.com/">Jon</a>, <a href="http://brightonnewmedia.org">Matt</a>, <a href="http://www.moving-edge.net/">Alex</a>, etc.) who I've not bumped into for a while. And interesting to hear about Moving Edge's experiences of really officelessness... it's one thing to sign up for that kind of existence in principle but carry on, as I have, doing things The Old Way - it's another to actually live it.
