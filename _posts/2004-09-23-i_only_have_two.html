<p>I had a wonderful night out last night: good food at the lovely <a href="http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/brighton__hove/leisure/eating_out/japanese/krakatoa.html">Krakatoa</a> restaurant, good friends and family (including some who I hardly see socially these days), and all the usual things I've come to expect from such a gathering:</p></p>

<p><ul>
<li>Filthy innuendo (with a worrying tendency towards quoting Star Wars);<li>Ludicrous quantities of booze thanks to the <a href="http://www.thisiseastbourne.co.uk/eastbourne/archive/2002/10/31/NEWS500ZM.html">Booze Brothers</a> and a big bottle of absinthe provided by Ju;
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005N5PQ/qid=1095955051/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i4_xgl/026-0374749-5472405">Twister</a> - a particularly violent variant that results in broken windows;
<li>The inevitable fighting;
</ul></p>

<p>Those who made it along made it, and those who missed it were missed. Thanks to all - and a particular "woo" to Jo, the waitress at Krakatoa who should get some sort of medal for going above and beyond the call of duty: serving 20 or so of us admirably during the meal, then joining the throng back at ours later.</p>

<p>Today has been... unproductive.</p>
