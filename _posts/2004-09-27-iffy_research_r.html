<p>I found <a href="http://www.mobilepipeline.com/47902950">this comment</a> weird:</p>

<blockquote><i>"The problem for Symbian is that they're only targeting higher-end phones, which form a tiny part of the (smartphone) market," ABI Research analyst Brian Pellegrini said in a statement. "Not too many people are going to have these expensive models. Most will have simpler 'enhanced' phones with a color screen, maybe a camera, but not many very advanced features."</i></blockquote>

<p>Uh? And Microsoft have a product for low- or mid-range handsets?</p>
