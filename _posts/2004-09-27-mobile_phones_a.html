<p>From <a href="http://www.canada.com/national/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=ce69a6f6-d06a-48db-97b9-83b2d3452fa9">Mobile Pipeline</a>:</p>

<blockquote>"<i>In Britain, the report says, police have confiscated mobile phones from people demonstrating against the war in Iraq.</i>"</blockquote>

<p>Or to be more accurate, the police are routinely using anti-terrorist legislation in <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3097150.stm">all sorts of ways</a>: like preventing someone from <a href="http://brightonnewmedia.org/archives/2004-September/064363.html">taking a photo</a> on Brighton beach this week. Presumably anyone who knows what Brighton beach looks like should keep schtum, in the name of national security...</p>
