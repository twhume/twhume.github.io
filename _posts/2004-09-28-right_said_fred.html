<p>It seems to be <a href="http://www.philsgaff.co.uk/">the season</a> for <a href="http://home.asparagine.net/blog/index.php?p=60#comments">office moves</a> - and <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">we're</a> heading into our new gaff on October 10th. Still sharing with the lovely <a href="http://www.redheaddesign.com/">Redhead Design</a> and <a href="http://www.neujuice.co.uk/">Neujuice</a>, but we're taking on a large space that'll give us room to expand (err and better fit in the folks we have now), plus a proper area to sit down and do the meeting thang with clients - not something we need a great deal as most of our meetings take place in London, but it can't hurt.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/85489791@N00/614216/" title="photo sharing"><img src="http://www.flickr.com/photos/614216_1148510fa2_m.jpg" alt="" style="border: solid 2px #000000;" /></a></p>

<p>FP has had 5 offices in the 4 years the company's been about, if you count the spare room where we started it all up and the 2 weeks we spent working out of my living room when we were badly let down over a promised space. Where we are now is easily the nicest place we've been in: the environment is great (thanks in part to sharing with folks who have an instinct for interior design), the location is fab (you can't beat the <a href="http://www.mybrightonandhove.org.uk/north_laine_history.htm">North Laine</a> for access to both station and entertainment) and the commercials are more favourable than some places we've inhabited. The new office is directly upstairs from the current one, so we should get to keep all our current advantages and still gain space. Wahey :)</p>

<p>And oh, did I mention we turned 4 on the 25th September? I can't believe it's been that long - it only feels like yesterday that I left <a href="http://www.goodtechnology.com/">GT</a>... and this also means that it's 5 years exactly since I started doing the mobile thang, when we launched GT Unwired, the wireless bit of GoodTech which google has long forgotten...</p>
