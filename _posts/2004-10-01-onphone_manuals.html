<p><a href="http://www.silkmobile.com/03case/cas_help.html">What a lovely idea</a>: your phone has its own manual just sitting there. It's always with you when you're out and about, and it's helping you to find new services and use your handset to the fullest - plus encouraging you to give new services a go. Of course you still need manuals *as well*: on-phone help is pretty useless if you can't work out  how o to turn the thing on, or the battery's out, or it breaks.</p>

<p>I met the guys at <a href="http://www.makeitclear.co.uk/">Clear</a> a couple of years back and they struck me as a really interesting bunch: extremely smart, and occupying a lovely little niche ("the explanation agency"). Good luck to them!</p>
