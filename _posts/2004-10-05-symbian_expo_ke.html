<p>I've not seen much of them, but so far it's "blah blah blah this mobile thing is going to be big blah blah blah new phase blah blah blah personal anecdote about child blah blah".</p>

<p>I mean, I don't expect much from The Big Presentations at these sort of events, but the little that I've seen today (wandering past the screens where they're being displayed) was pretty bland and preach-to-the-choir-ish...</p>

<p>Nice atmosphere at the event though. You can see lots of grizzled folks who've been bashing away at this stuff for years finally smelling their chance of success.</p>
