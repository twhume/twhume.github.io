<p>So I'm going to be chairing a session at next years <a href="http://www.icmg.mgovernment.org/europeanmg.htm">European mGovernment conference</a>, held just down the road from us on the <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/">Sussex University</a> campus at Falmer. The theme of the session will be "<i>Best practices for delivering mobile services to the mass market</i>", and will ideally include contributions from a range of people: operators, local government, service builders, handset vendors, and others. I'd like to concentrate on practical advice, ideally aimed at people who may not have any experience of mobile and what makes it different from other media. </p>

<p>Consider this a call for papers; if you'd like to speak at the event (which is the first conference I've seen which brings together mobile and government), send me (Tom dot Hume at futureplatforms dot com) a proposal for a paper, and CC it to submissions at mgovernment dot com. Submissions need to be in by 28th January 2005, but even if you don't have time to get a paper together, drop me a line and let me know you're interested...</p>
