<p>The Register <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/10/12/french_mobile_blockers/">reports</a> on the French government allowing cinemas to start blocking mobile phone signals (except emergency calls). Is the drop in cinema attendance in France really related to mobile phone use? Is this a phenomena unique to France? I'm certainly not aware of anyone I know deciding to avoid the cinema because of mobile phone users, and describing them as "thugs" seems a little on the harsh side - hopefully it's a mistranslation...</p>
