<p>Here's an interesting bit of news: <a href="http://marc.blogs.it/archives/2004/10/yelp.html">the founder of PayPal has backed Yelp!</a>, a service which helps you organise recommendations for local services.</p>

<p>I've been thinking a lot about local services recently, in relation to mobile (of course). Why doesn't Vodafone Live! or OrangeWorld have a "My Brighton" or equivalent menu on it - containing local <a href="http://www.whatsonguide.co.uk/">event listings</a>, the <a href="http://www.thisisbrightonandhove.co.uk/">front-page headline</a> from the local newspaper, <a href="http://www.friday-ad.co.uk/">classifieds</a> I might have demonstrated an interest in, <a href="http://www.brightonandhove.gov.uk/">information from the council</a> about my area (when the bins are being collected would be nice), <a href="http://www.upmystreet.com/">other demographic information</a>?</p>

<p>All this stuff is out there, and (gasp) it's relevant to me even when I'm away from my desk, or TV. And, tying in with <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/archives/004521.html">the long tail</a>... whilst information on Brighton might be of little value to someone in Liverpool, working out a way to deliver location-specific info to (say) residents of the largest 50 towns and cities in the UK would be incredibly useful. I suspect that the answer lies in doing deals with local newspaper syndicates, centralised sources of information, and local councils...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">We're</a> trying to push this along, of course. But I can't help feeling that it's more important that this gets done, than that we get to be the guys who do it.</p>
