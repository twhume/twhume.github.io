<p>A couple of quotes from <a href="http://www.newmediazero.com/lo-fi/story.asp?id=250080">recent</a> <a href="http://www.newmediazero.com/nmz/story.asp?id=249990">pieces</a> in New Media Age:</p>

<blockquote><i>"TV broadcasters know that people aren't loyal to a channel, they're loyal to its content."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"People relate to what's really part of their lives, not the operators providing the service."</i></blockquote>

<p>Is it as simple as this?</p>

<p>I mean, I don't for a minute believe that mobile owners get excited about their operator - and we've known for a while that they're more loyal to their choice of handset manufacturer than they are to their choice of operator.</p>

<p>But is it all about content? For me, personally, there are some channels which I have positive associations with (BBC1, Channel 4), and some which I have negative associations with (Channel 5, QVC)... I don't even know what's on QVC or Channel 5 right now, but I still feel averse to them, so presumably it's not as simple as me relating to the content of a channel. I'm more likely to give something unknown on BBC1 a go than I am if the same programme is on Channel 5 - so my choices are being influenced by my perception of the distribution mechanism as well as the content itself.</p>

<p>And is this not what the operators have been trying to do: create a perception that just because a piece of content is on Vodafone Live!, say, and is co-branded, that it is of quality?</p>
