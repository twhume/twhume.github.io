<p><a href="http://www.cocktailcreation.com/">Robert</a> and Jon (both ex-<a href="http://www.businesswire.com/webbox/bw.061402/221652016.htm">Scan</a>) wandered down to Brighton for yesterday evening, and having spend the last week bashing out proposals, I had an evening off and wandered out to meet them for a catch-up. They're interesting chaps, having done a dot-com-ish thing and been into mobile long before most of us, and we had a good chinwag in the Great Eastern before heading up to the Albert. </p>

To describe the gig as "intimate" would be a bit of an understatement. Thanks, we believe, to Bill Bailey playing in Brighton there wasn't much of a crowd. In fact there was, err, me and Jon (though a few more people turned up later - including a couple of the other acts - and swelled the audience to 8 or so). But undeterred, Robert held forth and cracked me up a couple of times. Plus he was invited back at some unspecified point in the future, which is a good result as I understand it.</p>
