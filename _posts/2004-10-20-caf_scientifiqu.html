<p>Ju and I wandered along to <a href="http://www.cafescientifique.org/brighton.htm">Caf&eacute; Scientifique</a> last night, held at the rather plus Terraces bar on the seafront. There were two speakers: the author <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/202-4121308-9617458">Simon Singh</a>, and a guy I know only as Andrew The Cosmologist.</p>

<p>Simon kicked off with a very entertaining talk, giving the background to the big bang theory, where it came from and how it was rejected by mainstream scientists for a number of years before gaining favour. In particular he focused on  nicely gratuitous experiments (setting fire to sodium and boron to demonstrate difference in flame colours, twirling a bleeper round his head to show the doppler effect) and the human side of key players in the field (Hubbles wifes first impression of the man, for instance - massively overblown superlatives comparing him to characters of Greek legend).</p>

<p>Andrew The Cosmologist took over for the last 10 minutes of the talk and basically said: "we don't know the answers". He also chucked a beachball representing the universe around the room a bit. I have a feeling that had we stuck around for questions, he would've had more of a chance to impress...</p>

<p>But a very well-attended, interesting event. I'll definitely be going back for the one on consciousness next month...</p>
