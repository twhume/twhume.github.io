<p>"<i>Earshot is leading on a licence application to Ofcom for RadioReverb to<br />
become a full-time community radio station for Brighton. RadioReverb is the<br />
station which was on air during the festival last May and had involvement<br />
from over 150 people. With a fulltime licence, RadioReverb will be able to<br />
build links to all parts of the community and encourage participation by<br />
community groups in producing programming and all aspects of running the<br />
station.</p>

<p>It is intended that the community radio station should provide benefits<br />
which extend beyond broadcasting. Training, empowerment, regeneration and<br />
off-air communication between community groups will form a vital part of the<br />
radio station operations and as such we hope to have a number of satellite<br />
studios based around the city in schools and other venues.</p>

<p>With a tight November 23rd deadline for licence applications, Earshot is<br />
currently in consultation with a number of interested groups and individuals<br />
in Brighton and Hove on behalf of RadioReverb and we would appreciate your<br />
input and support.</p>

<p>RadioReverb is currently run entirely by volunteers and broadcasts live on<br />
University Radio Falmer on 1431AM every Saturday from our studios in North<br />
Street.</p>

<p>You can get more information by emailing us at <a href="mailto:office@radioreverb.com">office@radioreverb.com</a>,<br />
phoning us on 01273 323040 or by downloading an information document and<br />
consultation form from the Earshot website at <a href="http://www.earshot.org.uk/">www.earshot.org.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Letters of support will need to be on letterhead and should include<br />
information on how you intend to make use of and benefit from RadioReverb.<br />
They should be addressed to:</p>
