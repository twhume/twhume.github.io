Nicki and Martins wedding went really well - much better than I'd expected, given the variety of factors which seemed to be conspiring against a happy weekend for all concerned. There's little point in going on about here in detail, as everyone who needs to know went, but: pub, thai, castle, waxwork, cake, bubbles, chocolate fountain, beer, disco-leg, wolf mask, elvis, oz, snow queen, and photography are all good places to start. The bride wore white for possibly the only time in recorded history. I didn't know there were white DMs...</p>

<p>Photos live <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/85489791@N00/sets/26439/">here</a> - yes, Flickr have finally persuaded me to pay for an account, the lovely lovely gits. Any other photos will be gratefully received and added here.</p>

<p>And here's my reading for anyone who cares; it's a poem by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/85489791@N00/sets/26439/">John Cooper Clarke</a>:<blockquote><i></p>

<p>"I wanna be your vacuum cleaner<br />
Breathing in your dust,<br />
I wanna be your Ford Cortina<br />
I will never rust,<br />
If you like your coffee hot<br />
Let me be your coffee pot,<br />
You call the shots,<br />
I wanna be yours.</p>

<p>I wanna be your raincoat<br />
For those frequent rainy days,<br />
I wanna be your dreamboat<br />
When you want to sail away,<br />
Let me be your teddy bear<br />
Take me with you anywhere,<br />
I don&rsquo;t care, I wanna be yours.</p>

<p>I wanna be your electric meter<br />
I will not run out,<br />
I wanna be your electric heater<br />
You&rsquo;ll get cold without,<br />
I wanna be your setting lotion<br />
Hold your hair in deep devotion,<br />
Deep as the Atlantic Ocean<br />
That&rsquo;s how deep is my devotion.</i>"</blockquote></p>
