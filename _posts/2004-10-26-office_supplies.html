<p>Thinking of placing an order with <a href="http://www.staples.co.uk/">Staples</a>? Don't bother. In nearly 4 weeks since we ordered through their web site we've sat on hold on 6 occasions and sent in 4 emails, without ever hearing from a human being about the status of our order (or even that it's been confirmed).</p>

<p>And if you're in the Brighton area, I can so far recommend <a href="http://www.odm-uk.com/">ODM</a>: one phone call, and the items we're after are due to be delivered by lunchtime today.</p>
