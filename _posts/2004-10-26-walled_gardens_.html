<p>An unfinished thought: how do we reconcile the perceived need for operators to open up their walled gardens, and one big reason why content owners are interested in mobile - easy billing?</p>

<p>I mean: we can't just let *anyone* stick a charge onto the bills of mobile subscribers. That's been tried with premium SMS, and the industry is now having to correct itself by cracking down on PSMS subscription services. So at some level, there'll be a divide between operator-approved partners who can bill for content, and unapproved ones who don't. </p>

<p>So even if the so-called garden walls are demolished (which I don't believe is necessary for operators and content owners to enjoy commercial success), there's still a divide, and a need for operators to vet and approve content providers.</p>
