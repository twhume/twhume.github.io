<p>It's been a busy time. We had a Big Meeting yesterday - which once we got into it, turned out to be quite enjoyable, but it was important so I'd spent a few days thinking about little else. Then it was off to see the Polyphonic Spree at the Old Market in Brighton; I am still deaf in one ear but despite being knackered it was a great gig.</p>
