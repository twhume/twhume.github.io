<p>It's been quite a stressful week, but a good one - for a couple of reasons.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that if you've seen me this week and I've seemed tired and snappy, it was all worthwhile - there'll be some good news on the <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">FP site</a> in the near future, we've just won a large and important piece of work which we're dead chuffed about.</p>

<p>As a result I shall be leaning towards "tired and emotional" (in the Private Eye sense) at <a href="http://www.wiredsussex.com/events/0410/dscapebd4d.asp">DScape04</a> this evening.</p>
