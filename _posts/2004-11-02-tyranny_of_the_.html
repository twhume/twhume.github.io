<p>Surely if very close to 50% of the population of a country disagree fundamentally over a long period with the other near-50%, then it's worth considering splitting into 2 countries and avoiding <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22john+stuart+mill%22+%22tyranny+of+the+majority%22&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&start=10&sa=N">the tyranny of the majority</a>?</p>

<p>I mean, what sort of mandate does 51% of the vote give you over the other 49% who didn't vote for you?</p>
