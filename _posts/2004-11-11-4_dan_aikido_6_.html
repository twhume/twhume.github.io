<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/85489791@N00/1412975/" title="photo sharing"><img align="left" hspace="10" src="http://www.flickr.com/photos/1412975_35db90b366_m.jpg" alt="" style="border: solid 2px #000000;" /></a>It was Maria's birthday today, so after a nice solid and well-attended class we repaired to the <a href="http://www.brightonlife.com/reviews/index.php?venue_id=100031">Walmer Castle</a> for "theory practice", the dishing out of gifts and the cake - a fantastic creation which <a href="http://www.logophage.net/">Steve</a> had arranged from <a href="http://www.choccywoccydoodah.com/">Chockywockydoodah</a>.</p>

<p>I was mildly surprised that you can walk into an English pub, ask the bar staff for "a really big, really sharp knife", and get what you're after.</p>

<p>Had to dash off earlier than I would've liked... back to the office to get a few bits and pieces out of the way. I had to turn down an opportunity for some work today. I'm really annoyed about it - it's not something I've ever had to do before, and it's absolutely gutting (the work sounded quite interesting and was for a good client we've worked for in the past). Hopefully our current <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/fp/careers.jsp">recruitment drive</a> will mean this doesn't happen again.</p>
