<p>When I first started weblogging a few people I know reacted quite aversely (and that's absolutely reasonable IMHO) to being mentioned or photographed online. I didn't understand it at the time, but now <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> is, to be quite frank, starting to scare me; for similar reasons, I suspect. Let me explain.</p>

<p>Last week I was up visiting a company we're working with in London. I took <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/85489791@N00/1216723/">a photo of the office</a> and posted it to my Flickr, and a day later had a "hello" from <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/celia/">Celia</a>, who it turns out I'd photographed. This week I was glancing at <a href="http://www.blackbeltjones.com/">Mr Jones</a> on Flickr and I see he's <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/blackbeltjones/1389688/">having dinner with Celia, Chris and Jess</a> (who we've worked for in the past). And tonight Chris is <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/blackbeltjones/1409692/">out and about</a> with (amongst others) <a href="http://www.petebarrwatson.com/">Pete</a>, another previous FP collaborator and local Brighton bod. Any second now, Kevin Bacon will show up and I win a cuddly toy or something.</p>

<p>Let's not mention the constant stream of <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/antimega/tags/food/">FoodPix</a>....</p>

<p>I feel almost guilty - like a stalker, getting these intimate views into the everyday lives of people, some of whom I know, some I'm yet to know. And at the same time it's absolutely compelling.</p>
