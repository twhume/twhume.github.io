<p>From <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/">Russell Beattie's notebook</a>, on "<a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008157.html">N-Gaging Piracy</a>":</p>

<p>"<i>Like you say, maybe piracy is a good thing for the N-gage, if it gets more people playing mobile games and starting to think about phones as a proper gaming platform. It's not good for games developers right now, who are losing revenue (and many of whom will go out of business).</p>

<p>I wonder how accepted MP3 and the like would be if they'd had DRM from day 1.</i>"</p>
