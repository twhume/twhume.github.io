<p><a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">QuickSilver</a> has completely changed the way I use the Mac.</p>

<p>I want to see QuickSilver for mobile phones. Just as <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,1522,,00.html?orig=/lifeblog">Lifeblog</a> brings together disparate sources of data and tabulates them into a single interface (messages, pictures, etc.), I want a tool that lets me start typing and just brings me what I want: calendar appointments, names, numbers, whatever.</p>

<p>There's a place for third-party applications on phones, but at a time when manufacturers are increasingly making the devices more capable (and more complex), then a dead simple interface onto the important stuff - people and communication - would satisfy the I-want-my-phone-to-be-a-phone brigade (who have a very valid point) whilst letting vendors slowly tie in additional sources of data over time. I wouldn't care how <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/archives/005213.html">overloaded the menu of my 7610 is</a> if I could bypass it to do 75% of the things I want to do with my phone.</p>

<p>And thinking about it, isn't Quicksilvers approach similar to "predictive text"? "Guess what you think I'm typing"...</p>
