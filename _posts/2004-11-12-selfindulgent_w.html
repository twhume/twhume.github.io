<p>Self-indulgent post, this... <a href="http://www.mobile-weblog.com/">Russell</a> asked me how much traffic my weblog got a month or so back... so I've been keeping an eye on it recently.</p>

<p>What happened in September? I can't see any new folks linking to me via google, I haven't been aware that the site is being promoted anywhere... but traffic has definitely spiked since then.</p>
