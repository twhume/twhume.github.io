<p>I've announced this once here already, but seeing as how traffic's bumped up <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/archives/005275.html">over the last few months</a>, it's probably worth re-stating:</p>

<p>Is anyone out there interesting in submitting a paper for next years mGovernment 2005 conference? <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/archives/004966.html">More details here</a>.</p>

<p>I've had some really strong submissions so far, but the more the merrier...</p>
