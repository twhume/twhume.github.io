<p><a href="http://www.tomhume.org/mt/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=5280">A comment</a> the mysterious John made on <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/archives/005280.html">a previous post</a> has got me thinking: what metadata can we get for free in a mobile context, without any intervention from the user? What can I automatically tag a photo (say) with when I take it? So far I've got:</p>

<p>1. Who I am: my phone number and some sort of ID (phone number, IMEI, bluetooth ID, whatever)<br />
2. Where I am: cell ID, country (inferred from the network I'm on, or my phone number perhaps) GPS co-ordinates, postcode (or whatever networks can offer)<br />
3. When I am: what time-zone, what time of day, date (and therefore day/night, season)<br />
4. What format (JPEG, PNG) and size my image is.</p>
