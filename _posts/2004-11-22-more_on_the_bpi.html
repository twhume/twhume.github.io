<p>An update on the <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/archives/005256.html">guy I wrote about</a> who's getting sued by the BPI: apparently they have rejected his offer of &pound;400 and are pushing for the full &pound;2000. I'm waiting to hear more about this - hopefully I should be getting a copy of the letters exchanged to put up here soon.</p>
