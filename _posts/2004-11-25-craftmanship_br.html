<p><a href="http://interconnected.org/home/2004/11/25/on_wisdom">Mr Webb quotes Mr Lee</a> and extrapolates. On a tangent...</p>

<p>When <a href="http://www.hecticjames.com/">Jame</a>s was organising a BN23 micro-conference last year, I started work on a short talk exploring parallels that I've noted between practicing Aikido and building software. IMHO there are consistencies to be found between any two disciplines, but these just happen to be the two which I've been personally involved with the longest.</p>

<p>When Tom's teaching class, one of the points he reiterates is that experts tend to come back to the basics: in aikido terms, it's not incredibly advanced throws or special techniques, but looking at how you transfer weight between your feet when you move... all the stuff which we do every day and take for granted.</p>

<p>Isn't this craftmanship?</p>
