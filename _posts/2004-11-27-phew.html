<p>Hmm, came into the office to get some work done this afternoon. Not gotten much done.</p>

<p>Ever had a 60-page technical document you've spent 2 weeks working on suddenly lose all formatting, tables, images, etc? It's not very much fun.</p>

<p>Thank god we actually have a sensible nightly backup-to-tape regime...</p>
