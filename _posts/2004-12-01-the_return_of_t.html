<p>We had an extremely panicked night last night. Monty (pictured) hadn't showed for breakfast in the morning - which is unusual but not unheard of.</p>

<p>But then he failed to turn up in the evening for supper, and that was very worring - it's never happened before and we're not exactly enjoying warm weather at the moment. So the evening was spent fretting, wandering around local streets whistling and calling for him, knocking on the neighbours doors, looking at the documentation we got when the cats were chipped, etc. etc.</p>

<p>There was no sign of him by midnight when I went to bed. I lay in bed dozing but not really sleeping, and then at about 4am this morning I'm woken up - and there he is, sitting on the end of the bed.</p>

<p>Phew.</p>
