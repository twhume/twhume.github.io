<p><img src="http://www.fudebakudo.com/graphics/zori_1_200_x_200.jpg" hspace="10" border="1" align="left">"<i>Forgetting your zori leads to a shameful breach of etiquette: Walking barefoot is forbidden, and clumping up to the edge of the mat in your boots or high-heels is vulgar. What to do? Fudebakudo, of course, has the answer with the downloadable zori -- brought to you by the combined technologies of origami and the&#160;internet..</i>"</p>

<p>Absolutely magical - martial arts nerds should <a href="http://www.fudebakudo.com/en/zori.html">head over here</a> for top <a href="http://www.fudebakudo.com/">Fudebakudo</a> action...</p>

<p>"<i>Strictly speaking, origami ends when stapling begins. But if you were being traditional you wouldn't have forgotten your zori in the first place. So secure the straps to the front of the slipper with a&#160;staple (you can use sticky tape instead). </i>"</p>
