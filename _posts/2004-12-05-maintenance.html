<p>Normal service will be restored as soon as possible... I'm about to start messing with the layout and template for this site...</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: right, done. To mark a year since I started using MovableType, and because I've generally become frustrated with t'blog over the last few months, I've reworked the template.</p>

<p>Why? Lots of reasons. The main one is that I don't like having titles for my posts - I think MovableType's default behaviour of requiring them has changed the way I write here; I don't just pop thoughts and ideas up like I used to when I used Radio Userland, but rather there's a pressure to think of a summary (usually something involving a pun) every time I post. I can still put titles onto posts of course - and probably shall continue to, for the benefit of folks reading my RSS feed.</p>

<p>The other reasons - blogroll being of limited value to anyone, the old template being a bit mucky and too "default" for my liking - are all minor by comparison. I'm interested to see if I start writing less but more often now that I've swapped over.</p>

<p>Anyhow, if you notice any problems, or have difficulty reading any of the site, my apologies. Drop a comment here or email me and I'll fix it...</p>
