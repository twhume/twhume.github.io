<p><a href="http://www.just-pooh.com/100acre.html">Hundred Acre Wood</a> is a <a href="http://www.just-pooh.com/ashdown.html">real place</a>. I think I knew this already, but had buried it in the back of my mind. I think we might wander that way for a game of <a href="http://www.just-pooh.com/poohsticks.html">poohsticks</a> come Sunday. Though of course you can <a href="http://www.poohsticks.com/">play it online</a> these days...</p>
