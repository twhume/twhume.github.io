<p>The Inquirer asks if <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=20065">the iPod is a tool to sell Macs</a>. Personally, my tumble down the slippery slope of Apple started with an iPod; once I'd had the delight of opening that fantastic packaging and the wonderful experience of using the accursed wobble box, I was absolutely sold on Apple - and it was only a matter of time before I cracked and started ABSOLUTELY NEEDING a PowerBook.</p>

<p>I suspect I'm not the only person who's been hooked in this way.</p>
