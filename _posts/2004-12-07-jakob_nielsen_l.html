<p>Jakob Nielsen lists <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20041206.html">the most hated advertising techniques</a>. As Steve writes <a href="http://www.tompeters.com/entries.php?note=007085.php">here</a>, "<i>The idea that the key to great marketing is just to shout at your customers for 30 seconds louder than your competitors are shouting is not an accurate description of how the world works. The key to your customers' love is not to act obnoxious enough that they can't help but pay attention.</i>".</p>
