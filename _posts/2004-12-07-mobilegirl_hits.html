<p>MobileGirl <a href="http://mobilegirl.blogspot.com/2004/12/happy-mobile-monday.html">hits the nail on the head</a>: "<i>The point here is that the technology is changing the meaning of the artifact</i>".</p>

<p>The thing your phone records is called a photo, and the thing your film camera records is called a photo, but that doesn't mean you should directly compare the two - they're using for very different things.</p>

<p>On top of this I'd expect there to be some change in how photos are used in a mobile context, particularly as <a href="http://www.commsdesign.com/news/market_news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=54201810">network effects kick in</a>...</p>
