<p>Romain David <a href="http://onwireless.blogspot.com/2004/12/mobertainment.html">talks about televisual content</a>, its suitability for mobile, and opportunities for interaction with the content. We've been thinking about this recently for a client, too - and whilst I'm not sure how much people *want* to interact with this sort of content (isn't passivity one of the attractive things about soaps? if not, why aren't soap viewers out LARPing?) the ability to talk, and listen, to an audience who care deeply about a subject (any subject) can't help but change the medium... can't it?</p>

<p>In any case, the notion that video content for mobile needs to be developed with mobile in mind (as opposed to bland repurposing of what's out there already) seems to be obvious to me - like many good ideas do, once you've heard them :)</p>

<p>But Romain, "mobertainment"? OW! ;)</p>
