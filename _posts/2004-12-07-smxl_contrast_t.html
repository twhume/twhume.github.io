<p>SMXL <a href="http://smlxtralarge.com/archives/000089.php">contrast the down-turn</a> in premiership viewing figures with operator plans for video downloads via 3G, and finish with a call for operators to consider <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/archives/004521.html">niche communities</a>:</p>

<blockquote>"<i>So, mobile operators don't forget the bird watchers, what could you do for them on 3G or the Fishing crazies. Its not just Premiership goals where you future revenue will come from.</i>"</blockquote>

<p>Heh.</p>
