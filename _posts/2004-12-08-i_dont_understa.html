<p>I don't understand <a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/archive/2004/12/07/desktop_search_.html">the importance of desktop search from mobiles</a>, except for a very limited cross-section of the population. It's much like the ability to take Excel spreadsheets with you on your PDA; I'm sure a few people need it, but not as many people as buy the kit to do this sort of thing...</p>

<p>The emphasis on the desktop and the PC strikes me as a very US-centric view of mobile, crow-barring it into a well understood context rather than seeing it as something new.</p>
