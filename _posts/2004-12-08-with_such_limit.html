<p>With such limited screen space, aren't the lines between <a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/communications/0,2000061791,39172387,00.htm">contextual advertising</a> and interruptive advertising a bit blurred? I mean, if there's an ad on my phone screen then it's using space that I want to use for *my* stuff - I don't care how relevant it is.</p>

<p>Maybe what we need is the mobile equivalent of "press red for more" - a subtly advertised means of alerting users to the existing of further info, which they can choose to access, as opposed to shoving it on-screen and whining that it's "relevant".</p>
