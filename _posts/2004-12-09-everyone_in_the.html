<p>Everyone in the whole world went to <a href="http://www.heyotwell.com/engaged2004/">Design Engaged</a> - except me.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.v-2.org/displayArticle.php?article_num=908">Adam writes it up </a>: "<i>Change got here a few minutes past nine in the morning, Wednesday before last, and it's been waiting on your doorstep ever since - alongside its mate difficulty</i>".</p>

<p>I also like his point about the line between creator and consumer vanishing. In a sick way I'm really looking forward to the Next Big Thing, and going from Not Getting It to Getting It. What will my children and grand-children (invisible superhero in space permitting) take for granted, that I just can't fathom?</p>
