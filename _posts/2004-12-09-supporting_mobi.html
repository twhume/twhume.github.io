<p><a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=101270">Supporting mobile music for all the wrong reasons</a>:</p>

<p>Actually, I suspect that mobile is the one place where <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2003/10/13.html#a1792">DRM *could* work</a> - as the platforms and networks are more tightly controlled than in general-purpose PC land. Whether this could be done long-term is a different matter, and personally I believe DRM to be marginally less evil than drowning kittens.</p>
