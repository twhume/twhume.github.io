<p>James <a href="http://www.hecticjames.com/weblog/archives/000547.html">has been investigating Unicode</a> for a project we have on at the moment. We have all learned more than we ever hoped to about this subject, though my suggestion that Elvish ought to be supported thanks to the unusually high lifetime value of elvish customers wasn't met with enthusiasm...</p>
