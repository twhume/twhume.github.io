GT Bashes are usually held in interesting locations (e.g. Aldwych tube station, Barcelona) and this years was in Holborn NCP car park.</p>

<p>We had a really great time; the music was ace (<a href="http://www.frenchbloke.tk/">Frenchbloke & Son</a>), we caught up with a <a href="http://www.badgers-in-foil.co.uk/">few</a> <a href="http://home.asparagine.net/blog/">old</a> <a href="http://www.philsgaff.co.uk/">faces</a> (and unfortunately failed to catch up with a couple of others), and <a href="http://www.logophage.net/">Steve</a> did his infectious dancing thing to perfection.</p>
