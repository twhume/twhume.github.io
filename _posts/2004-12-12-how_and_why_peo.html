<p><a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2004/HPL-2004-216.html">How and why people use camera phones</a>: "<i>...the camera phone is neither an incremental step forward from a mobile phone, nor a poor relation of a digital camera.  Rather, it is a device which is sometimes used rather like a digital camera, but is different in the range of activities it supports.</i>" (via <a href="http://www.gooby.org/">Jay</a>)</p>
