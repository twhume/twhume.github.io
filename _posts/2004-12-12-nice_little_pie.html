<p>Nice little piece about a BBC consultation of children as part of the charter review, and the enthusiasm kids expressed for mobile. CBBC <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/whatson/christmas/">are very active with mobile</a> (and announced <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/05_may/17/cbbc_search.shtml">some interesting stuff</a> back in May).</p>
