<p><a href="http://www.mobilepipeline.com/55301281">Gah!</a> "<i>3G will be attractive primarily to gizmo freaks who care about cool factor and to enterprises with applications that demand ubiquity, such as field service representatives who require access to corporate data from the road or customer sites.</i>"</p>

<p>Of course it will. Because look at the fixed-line internet, eh? The only people who moved beyond dial-up were gizmo freaks, weren't they? I mean, ubiquity is just something for corporations, isn't it? Mobile phones are just for talking, aren't they? This Internet thing will never take off...</p>
