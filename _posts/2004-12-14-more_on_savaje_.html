<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/12/13/savaje_wins_lg/">More on Savaje</a>; given that we spend a lot of our time doing mobile Java stuff these days, Savaje is very interesting. Unfortunately they seem to engage mainly with their partners - operators and the like - which means that we're not in a position to get experience with Savaje OS - something I'd dearly like us to do.</p>
