<p><a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000974.php">Getting the budget out of a client</a>: "<i>When they tell you they don&rsquo;t have a number say, &ldquo;Oh, ok. So a $100,000 solution would work for you?&rdquo; They&rsquo;ll quickly come back&#8230; &ldquo;Oh no, probably something more around $30K.&rdquo; BINGO: That&rsquo;s the budget.</i>"</p>

<p>"Guess the budget" is my favourite game in the world, ever.</p>
