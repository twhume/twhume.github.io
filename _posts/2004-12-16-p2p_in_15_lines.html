<p><a href="http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/software/molester/">P2P in 15 lines of Python</a>. I hereby propose the arrogantly titled Hume's Law: that when a technology can be expressed by printing onto a single T-shirt, attempts to control it can be pronounced failed.</p>

<p>Yeah OK, there is another <a href="http://www.coronetbooks.com/books/hume0446.htm">Hume's law</a>, but mine's way better.</p>
