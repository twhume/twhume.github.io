<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/games/0,2101,66023,00.html">Review of Mario Party</a>: "<i>Nintendo loves to experiment with new methods of game control, and recently it's been working out well -- for example, the touch screen on the Nintendo DS, or the bongo drums included with Donkey Konga. But with a lack of compelling content, it's hard not to view the GameCube Mic as a gimmick.</i>"</p>
