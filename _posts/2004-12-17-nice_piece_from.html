<p><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html">Nice piece from Joel</a> on the economics of selling software: "<i>The answer is really complicated. I'm going to start with a little economic theory, then I'm going to tear the theory to bits, and when I'm finished, you'll know a lot more about pricing and you still won't know how much to charge for your software, but that's just the nature of pricing. </i>"</p>
