<p>Tim Berners-Lee <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=101297">on the stupidity of the .mobi domain</a>: "<i>It&rsquo;s important to keep the Web devices independent and get Web designers to use all the clever techniques for making the data as re-usable as possible.</i>"</p>

<p>I'd also not that if you want to segregate your mobile content into a different place, you don't need a new domain to do that: www.futureplatforms.com, ftp.futureplatforms.com, wap.futureplatforms.com, etc. etc.</p>
