<p>Not only has game specialist ad network Massive <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/archives/005493.html">launched</a>, but they have Nielsen <a href="http://www.clickz.com/news/article.php/3448421">signed up</a> to provide third party auditing of ad units sold.</p>

<p>I'm not a big fan of traditional advertising shoehorned into new media, but at least this indicates that the commercial world is taking gaming seriously as a channel in its own right...</p>
