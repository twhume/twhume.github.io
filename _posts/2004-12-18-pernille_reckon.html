<p>Pernille <a href="http://www.pernillerudlin.com/blog/archives/2004_12.html">reckons</a> that mobile data usage is higher in Europe and Japan in part because of train commute times giving us a chance to use such services.</p>

<p>I think that might be one explanation, but I'm not sure it can completely explain the difference, for a couple of reasons: firstly most of the population of the UK don't travel to work by train/bus each day, and secondly, from what I recall last time I looked at figures for services we've run, WAP usage is highest in the evenings and at weekends...</p>

<p>On a side note: I'd really like to be able to look at my own usage patterns; to get my mobile bill in some digital format and analyse that see how and when I actually use my phone. When am I texting the most? When am I sending picture messages, making voice calls, and so on?</p>
