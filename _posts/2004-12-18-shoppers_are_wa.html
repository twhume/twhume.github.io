<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4097391.stm">Shoppers are wary of chip and pin</a> - I'd put myself into the "wary" box. It seems way more insecure to have to type in a 4-digit number (easily seen by anyone standing near you) than to have to write a signature... <b>presuming these signatures get checked</b>.</p>

<p>I wonder how many people have the same PIN number for their "chip and pin" transactions as they do for their ATM transactions? At least I couldn't look at your signature, steal your card, and run off to withdraw cash... is this shifting risk away from merchants and towards consumers?</p>
