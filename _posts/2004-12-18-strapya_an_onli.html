<p><a href="http://www.strapya.com/top.htm">StrapYa</a> - an online store for those dangly little mobile straps.</p>

<p>One of my favourite "features" of the 7610 is the little strap it came with - I think because it gives me something to fiddle with when I'm not doing anything with my phone, and turns the rounded yet plasticky device into something a bit more organic...</p>
