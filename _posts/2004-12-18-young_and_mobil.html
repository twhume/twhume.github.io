<p><a href="http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/006408.htm">Young and mobile - should we be worried</a>: "<i>It's exploiting children to make money. It's normalising and glamourising five-year-olds having cellphones.</i>"</p>

<p>Yet I remember exactly this from when I, and my sister, were children - and some of my 4-year-old nieces favourite toys include a (fixed-line) toy telephone, on which she enjoys long and fascinating conversations with her imaginary friends. I don't see anything unhealthy about children becoming acclimatised to telephone conversations (in much the same way that I doubt we'd see anything unhealthy about children learning about cars and playing with toy cars at an early age).</p>

<p>Communication is a pretty universal human drive, even at an early age...</p>
