<p>More on chip and pin - "<i><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4108433.stm">A leading security expert has warned that new chip and pin credit and debit cards could be open to fraud</a></i>".</p>

<p>I thought the justification for C&Ps security was particularly poor: "<i>We don't think they can use fake machines because the machines themselves are engineered to read the chip so they must be reading the chip very carefully</i>". Yeah but no but yeah but...</p>

<p>So - what's to stop me buying or stealing a real machine and altering it to record PIN numbers? Even if the cards themselves are difficult to forge (something which doesn't traditionally discourage forgers of, say, currency or digital set-top-box smartcards), the authentication data needed - your PIN number - is weak because it (a) will usually serve 2 purposes: to identify you when you're making a transaction, and when you're using an ATM, and (b) is far more easily faked than a signature.</p>
