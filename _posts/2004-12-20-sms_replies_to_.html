<p>Aha! Just noticed that Nokia have fixed one of my big gripes in the 7610... you can reply to an MMS by sending back a text message easily.</p>

<p>Up until now I've continually found myself receiving a picture message then having to exit, go back to messaging and compose a text - really annoying. I had quite cynically thought this might be a way to deliberately bump up MMS revenues - and am glad to be proved wrong :)</p>
