<p>On the way between class and our traditional Sunday evening takeaway, I was talking to <a href="http://www.logophage.net/">Steve</a> last night about the <a href="http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com/en/m/intro/index.html">campaign against software patents</a>. I was vaguely aware of it but hadn't really heard much fuss in the press (compared, say, to the <a href="http://www.charter88.org.uk/no2idcards/">anti-ID cards activism</a>).</p>

<p>It sounds really scary. As I understand it, broad patents will allow large software companies to form cartels, in which each member cross-licenses IP to the others and thereby keep smaller organisations from innovating. Even the threat of legal action would frequently be enough to cause individuals or organisations to stop what they're doing (as <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/archives/005256.html">we know from the music industry</a>).</p>

<p>It's like <a href="http://www.itweb.co.za/sections/internet/2002/0203041224.asp?S=Internet&A=INT&O=FRGN">interconnect fees</a> for ideas. Bad stuff.</p>
