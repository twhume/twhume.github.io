<p>SK Telecom are <a href="http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/006475.htm">sponsoring art for mobiles</a>, letting users download and display masterpieces as wallpapers.</p>

<p>This seems to be an area which has been massively under-exploited to date; we've been in vague discussion with a client to try and get them doing something along these lines (and then heading off in a slightly different direction, of course ;)).</p>

<p>No-one "owns" art on mobile, in the way that various companies are trying to "own" gaming, or music.</p>
