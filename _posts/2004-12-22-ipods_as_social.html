<p><a href="http://www.ratcliffeblog.com/archives/000258.html">The iPod as a social networking tool</a>: "<i>Well, their iPods have allowed them to create personal playlists that they carry along as a soundtrack to their lives. When they publish their playlists to Rendezvous networks in their dorms, other students surf those playlists to get an idea what people are like.</i>"</p>

<p>Another part of this article really reminded me of LifeBlog: "<i>Using the touch wheel, they scroll through the whole collection in a couple minutes, presenting a kind of time-lapse view of their lives. It lets them share in a few minutes a lifetime of experience and discover things in common.</i>"</p>

<p>I find it weird that, despite the increasing availability of bandwidth, having your stuff with you physically is compelling. I suspect a generation that grows up with 3G may feel differently.</p>
