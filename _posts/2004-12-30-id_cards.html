<p>On ID cards: "<a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=20374">the really sad thing is that Blunkett has resigned over trivialities</a>", it's "<a href="http://www.idealgovernment.com/index.php/weblog/draft_kim_cameron_piece/">information disaster waiting to happen</a>" and "<a href="http://www.richardallan.org.uk/index.php?p=291#comments">the cards are the wrong tool for the jobs that are being proposed for them so they will most likely remain unused at great expense</a>". I had a curt response from my MP (who I'd <a href="http://www.faxyourmp.com/">faxed</a> before Christmas) thanking me for my letter and explaining that he saw no issue with the introduction of ID cards. Thankyou Mr Lepper.</p>
