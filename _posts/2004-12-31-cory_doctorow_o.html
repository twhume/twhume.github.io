<p>Cory Doctorow <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/12/29/cory_responds_to_wir.html">on DRM fallacies</a>: "<i>There's no reason to believe that DRM makes more content available. There's no reason to let the studios "call the shots" -- we haven't before this. There's no reason to believe that DRM makes media cheaper, quite the contrary. The features that make your "reasonable" DRM palatable to the market today can and are rescinded tomorrow.</i>"</p>
