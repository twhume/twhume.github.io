<p>It's not just for gadget freaks and techno-utopians; this stuff has a party to play even during harsh times:</p>

<p>Flickr is <a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/archive/2005/01/03/missing_persons.html">being used</a> to help locate <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/tsunami_help_missing/">missing persons</a>...</p>

<p>...and <a href="http://www.priyascape.com/">Priya Prakash</a> has a WAP site for <a href="http://www.priyascape.com/helpline/index.wml">emergency numbers</a> (which I notice links through to a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/mobile/tsunami/">BBC WAP site</a>)</p>
