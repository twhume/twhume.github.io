<p>Bobbie <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/online/archives/mobile_phones/2005/01/just_getting_into_the_idea_of_3g.html">asks what the killer app for 3G is</a>: "<i>video calling hasn't really taken off, so perhaps it will just be about fast download times and interconnectivity</i>".</p>

<p>Hmm, what was the killer app for v32bis? Or for ISDN? Or for ADSL?</p>

<p>IMHO it's not about the networks, it's about getting them plugged into peoples lives. The killer app for the fixed-line internet was web access, because it was so universal and could be applied in so many ways. So err... it's "just" connectivity.</p>
