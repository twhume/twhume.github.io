<p>Sorry to bang on about it, but is Flickr+cameraphone a better blogging tool than most blogging tools?</p>

<p>I've noticed recently that my friends can get a much better view of what I'm up on a day-to-day to by watching <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/twhume/">my Flickr feed</a> than by reading my <a href="http://tomhume.org/">weblog</a> (which, let's face it, is quite dull if you're not into the same stuff I am). It's just much easier to me to pop photos up than it is to write a story - pictures being worth a thousand words and all that.</p>

<p>Plus, people who don't know or care about blogs <a href="http://www.brightonandhovetas.org.uk/">get it</a>.</p>

<p>So, here's my bet: as this stuff gets more popular, blogging tools that are focused around easily getting video and imagery out of our phones and into the eyes of our friends will be where the mass market turn... leaving essayists with the more texty tools that we know and love today.</p>
