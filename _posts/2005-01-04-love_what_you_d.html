<p>Pete's <a href="http://home.asparagine.net/blog/index.php?p=93">pointed</a> to this lovely quote: "<i>If you enjoy programming computers, count your blessings: you are in a very fortunate minority of people who can make a great living doing work they enjoy. Most people aren&rsquo;t so lucky. The very idea that you can &ldquo;love your job&rdquo; is a modern concept. Work is supposed to be something unpleasant you do to get money to do the things you actually like doing, when you&rsquo;re 65 and can finally retire, if you can afford it, and if you&rsquo;re not too old and infirm to do those things, and if those things don&rsquo;t require reliable knees, good eyes, and the ability to walk twenty feet without being out of breath, etc.</i>"</p>

<p>Personal anecdote: when I was 19 I spent a summer working in the refrigerated cold-store of a dairy, pushing trolleys of milk around from 8am and 6am. It was OK - I got reasonably fit over the course of the summer and it gave me some spending money and something to do.</p>

<p>But there were a couple of old guys there who'd been there 30+ years, doing this every day... and from talking to them, it wasn't something which got them fired up, just a necessary means to support themselves.</p>

<p>Getting paid for doing something you enjoy is a massive privilege.</p>
