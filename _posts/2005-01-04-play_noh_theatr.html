<p>More on <a href="http://www.aikidojournal.com/?id=442">the kata of play</a> from Peter Goldsbury: "<I>...one can know about the art only through the experience of performing it and becoming skilled. It should not be possible to articulate this experience in any way other than the forms (katachi) of that skill (waza).</i>"</p>
