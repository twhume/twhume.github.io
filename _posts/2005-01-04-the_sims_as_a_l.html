<p><a href="http://llt.msu.edu/vol9num1/purushotma/default.html">Modifying The Sims to turn it into a learning environment</a>: "<i>...a modification to the number one selling video game The Sims that intelligently combines game data from the English edition with data from editions of other languages to form a bilingual gaming environment.
