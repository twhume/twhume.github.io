<p><a href="http://www.ecademy.com/module.php?mod=club&op=forum&c=24&t=203189#203885">Interesting point</a> from Thomas Maufer: "<i>the growth rate of voice... basically scales with the size of the population, which grows at a relatively slow rate</i>". File under "bloody obvious, why didn't I realise that".</p>

<p>Voice traffic scales with population size. Data traffic has no such limitation.</p>
