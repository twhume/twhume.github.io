<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4151431.stm">Casual gaming to take off in 2005</a>: "<i>Easy-to-play titles that do not require too much time and that are playable online or downloadable to mobile devices will see real growth in the coming year.</i>"</p>

<p>I'd certainly agree with that; <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">we</a> have 2 projects on at the moment which tie into this trend... it just makes sense. Mobile is mass market; games which are successful on mobile will be those that fit well into the context of mobile use, and have broad appeal.</p>
