<p>Something Jay said at zazen on Friday resonated with me and I couldn't work out why: "<i>we sit with the universe</i>".</p>

<p>At the risk of sounding like a tired old hippy (and we all know that the hippies must die), our industry seems pleased as punch with itself that suddenly everyone is getting networked - that we communicate with and influence not just those around us, or those in the next town or country, but everyone everywhere.</p>

<p>And then you look back at these old <a href="http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/buddhabrot/">Buddhist</a> guys... and they've been saying exactly the same thing for thousands of years. The hi-tech industry is playing catchup with monks who died 2 millenia ago - doh.</p>

<p>It's been a weird week for it all btw. Jay and Heather, who run the zazen group, turned up to Aikido on Thursday to have a look at what we do... and then Tom Helsby came along with me to zazen on Friday.</p>

<p>I can only liken the sensation to how I imagine it feels when you and your partners parents first meet: on best behaviour and praying fervently that everyone gets on.</p>
