<p>In a fit of New Years lets-do-something-new-ness, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/twhume/tags/ju/">Ju</a> and I have signed up for an introductory <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capoeira">Capoeira</a> course with <a href="http://www.capoboneco.org.uk/">these guys</a> - and it was the first evening tonight.</p>

<p>It was really good fun - that seemed to be the defining principle. As <a href="http:///www.fudebakudo.com/">other people</a> have <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0954454308/qid%3D1105396956/202-4731648-6629460">noted</a>, Capoeira seems to avoid the po-faced seriousness of many oriental martial arts (oh yes - you can practice with a feeling of "joyful exhilaration" all you like once you've spent half an hour in agony on your knees ;)).</p>

<p>We arrived early and watched a few minutes of the previous class - which was finishing with a big happy sing-song. Then after lining up and paying for the 5-week course, the instructor, Boneco, got us doing a warm-up: lots of jumping up and down and sweeping movements, then leg lifts and some spinny sort of kicks (not being a punchy kicky guy I don't really know the proper names for these things). Lots of partner practice followed - which I found really nice, coming from <a href="http://www.aikiweb.com/">aiki-land</a> where this sort of thing dominates - and then we worked up the hall attempting to do semi-cartwheel things with various degrees of success.</p>

<p>...and suddenly an hour and a half had passed, and the class finished with everyone standing round clapping and singing whilst some of Bonecos students played a tamborine and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berimbau">Berimbau</a>. Everyone seemed to be having a really good time - I'm looking forward to next week already :)</p>
