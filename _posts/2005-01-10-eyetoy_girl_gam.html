<p>An extended piece from the Guardian <a href="http://www.prandial.com/archives/2005_01.html#009045">on the EyeToy</a>, by Andrew Losowsky: "<i>Instead of studying the manual and tapping complicated combos, you should be able to record and then replay your own special moves in a dancing or a fighting game.

It didn't exactly help them score higher but it was bloody funny so they kept doing it.</i>"</p>
