<p>Miscellaneous interface-related stuff I've bookmarked but not had time to blog recently:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.peterme.com/archives/000444.html">PeterMe on folksonomies</a>
<li> Mr Webb on <a href="http://interconnected.org/home/2005/01/05/i_got_the_wave">wave messaging</a>. The tilt sensor in the cover sounds really cool: imagine a handset interface where you shake it, etch-a-sketch-style, to return to your home screen... or flick the phone to answer (or finish) a call. (Where are gestural interfaces on PDAs, anyway?)
<li> Mr Jones on <a href="http://blackbeltjones.typepad.com/work/2005/01/shirky_tufte_x_.html">sparklines and Wikipedia</a>
</ul>
