<p>I am a big fan of stupidity. Much as Larry Wall <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LazinessImpatienceHubris">believes</a> the virtues of a programmer to be laziness, hubris, and impatience, I think stupidity is massively under-rated. As a culture we don't like admitting that we can't foresee the consequences of everything we do; and as such we're driven to do smart stuff and ignore those consequences.</p>

<p>"<i>More and more money will go into making a great customer experience, and less will go into shouting about the service. Word of mouth is becoming more powerful. If you offer a great service, people find out.</i>"</p>
