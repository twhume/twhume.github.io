<p>MobileGirl on <a href="http://mobilegirl.blogspot.com/2005/01/what-it-really-means-to-design-for.html">what it really means to design for mobile</a>: "<i>It's not about interacting with the desktop. It's about making the mobile device a central unit and it's about placing a focus on the whole system... the phone and the desktop (maybe even the TV and radio). It's about figuring out when to push, when to pull, when to alert, notify, sync, and require confirmation.</i>"</p>
