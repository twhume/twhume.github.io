<p><a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=20692">Mobile health risks</a>: "<i>The real dilemma is deciding whether mobile phones constitute a real threat like cigarettes or an imaginary threat as per the radiation threat to pregnant women from VDU screens in the 80s.</i>"</p>

<p>Very important, particularly given the high usage of mobile amongst children (though whether they're actually high users of voice - which is presumably the most risky activity - is a different matter, I've not seen the figures). </p>

<p>One of the scenarios outlined in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00067PY80/qid=1105655107/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/202-4731648-6629460">Wireless Foresight</a> (one of the 4 or so books I'm currently ploughing through) is exactly this: a health scare sets the mobile industry back by 5 years or so, leaving the public reticent to use mobile and forcing telecomms businesses to re-engineer much of their infrastructure in order to reassure their customers.</p>
