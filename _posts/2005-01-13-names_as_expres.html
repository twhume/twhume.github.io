<p>Joseph Laszlo <a href="http://weblogs.jupiterresearch.com/analysts/laszlo/archives/005916.html">points to a poll on Wi-fi hotspot SSIDs</a>: "<i>When you think about it, an SSID is a means of self expression, though a limited, and kind of a weird one. You may as well be creative about it.</i>"</p>

<p>As here, so with handles for instant messaging (which are a tool for self-expression as well as for identification) and bluetooth device names... I've been using <a href="http://www.mobiluck.com/">MobiLuck</a> recently to track devices that I get near... leave it for a day or so and then check the list of Bluetooth IDs it's accumulated...</p>
