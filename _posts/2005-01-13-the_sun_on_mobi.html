<p>Interesting that UK tabloid newspaper The Sun are <a href="http://www.moconews.net/index.php?p=1156">launching a mobile portal</a>, but it's not one of the rash of Java portals <a href="http://www.mobile-weblog.com/archives/i_always_feel_sorry_for_sun_readers.html">we've seen recently</a> - but rather a WAP effort: "<i>Sun Mobile gives us a direct, interactive relationship with our customers on mobile.</i>"</p>

<p>IMHO this makes the most sense. Co-branded versions can be produced for operators, allowing the Sun to get distribution, traffic, and revenue through them (and remember, there's a closer correlation between traffic and revenue with mobile than there ever was with the web). And at the same time they can promote an own-brand version too, with little incremental cost. Oh, and they're not paying a supplier to reimplement a WAP browser for them in the process.</p>
