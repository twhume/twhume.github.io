<p>Samples quotes:</p>

<p>"<i>In one sentence, games are fun because they allow us to rehearse basic survival skills and we are hard-wired through evolution to feel good when we do that.</i>" - Noah Falstein</p>

<p>"<i>People are pattern-matching machines and we find pleasure in patterns.</i>" - David Thomas</p>

<p>"<i>What a silly thing it is that we insist on propagating that epithet anyway, 'gamers'. Do you ever hear Hollywood targeting a film for 'hard-core moviegoers'? Or a publisher talking about a new book that will really get the 'bookreaders' talking?</i>" - Ian Bogost</p>

<p>Suzie Cardwell also had some nice thoughts on casual gaming, prompting me to google and find her <a href="http://www.tech.port.ac.uk/staffweb/eylesm/wig-website/conf-2004/downloads/suzie-cardwell.ppt">powerpoint presentation</a> on women and casual gaming - well worth a look.</p>
