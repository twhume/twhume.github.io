<p>Mizuko Ito <a href="http://www.itofisher.com/mito/archives/000072.html">on cameraphone adoption and usage</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li> "<i>Most photos taken by the camera phone are not sent or  shown to others, but are captured more as a personal visual archive.</i>"
<li> "<i>One type of visual capture for personal use is visual note taking.</i>": I find myself doing this a lot - snapping posters, products or news stories that I know I want to remember later.
<li> "<i>...an emergent practice of  visually archiving an individual&rsquo;s everyday life.  These photos are not posed  or staged, or particularly well-framed our thought out. Rather, they are  snapped casually, with the intention of possibly looking at them a little later,  recording a momentary slice of a viewpoint on everyday life. </i>"
<li> "<i>...sharing photos feels more &ldquo;intrusive&rdquo; than email, and  tend to feel more narcissistic</i>"
</ul>
