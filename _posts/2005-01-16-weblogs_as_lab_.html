<p><a href="http://enthusiasm.cozy.org/archives/2005/01/lab-book/">Weblogs as lab books</a>: "<i>I do like to the use the blog as a way to create a string of beads along this or that thread in my thoughts. I don&rsquo;t feel these beads need to be particularly well formed, just a bit more solid than a passing whim; but certainly not defensible to any particular degree.</i>"</p>
