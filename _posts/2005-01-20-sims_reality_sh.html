<p><a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=20811">EA wants a Sims reality TV Show</a>: "<i>When asked by reporters which television company would want to buy such a show, the SpokesEA jerkily stood up and went into the kitchen for no apparent reason.</i>"</p>

<p>El Reg complains that this would be "like watching paint dry", which seems like a good description of most reality TV to me...</p>
