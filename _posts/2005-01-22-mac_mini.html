<p>Russell is the first person I know to <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008275.html">get hold of a Mac mini</a>, and I am insanely jealous. I'm starting to feel the AppleLust again - as I did with both PowerBook and iPod...</p>

<p>In particular I'm wanting to look at it as a home media centre thingy (I'm completely with <a href="http://home.asparagine.net/blog/index.php?p=103">Mr Cringely</a> on that one - when a company whose main product is fantastic interfaces releases a box without a UI, you know something's up). Right now we have an iMac which I got hold of last year running iTunes, but something that plugs directly into the TV and isn't dog-slow would be ooooooh so nice....</p>

<p>The mechanics of clubbing together to sort out a birthday pressie for Russ was also quite straightforward, as <a href="http://www.postneo.com/2005/01/22/emerging-gift-giving-technology">Matt's noted</a> - though being a bit of a luddite, I only got involved by email, SMS and PayPal... though the <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/default.asp">JustGiving</a> guys have been making group transactions for ages I guess, and I'll be interested to see what grows up around <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/PledgeBank">pledgebank</a>...</p>
