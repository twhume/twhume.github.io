<p><a href="http://www.petsmobility.com/index3.html">PetsMobility</a>: "<i>PetsCell&#153; will allow pet owners to talk to their pets as well as allowing owners to request assistance should they become incapacitated and require help. In addition, and perhaps more valuable, pet owners will have a piece of mind that if their pet is lost and someone finds their pet wandering the streets, with a simple press of a button on the PetsCell&#153;, the auto dial function will dial the owners home alerting the owner to retrieve their pet.</i>"</p>
