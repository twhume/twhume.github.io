<p><a href="http://www.logophage.net/">Steve<a/> mentioned <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/online/archives/software/2005/01/eus_dirty_tricks_on_software_patents.html">this</a> to me the other day: "<i>The EU Software Patent Directive has been or will be scheduled on the agenda of the Agriculture and Fishery Meeting of the 24th of January as an A item, i.e. an item that is to be adopted without a vote.</i>"</p>

<p>I don't know much about the workings of the EU, but it strikes me that asking an Agriculture and Fishery Meeting to rule on intellectual property for software isn't totally appropriate.</p>
