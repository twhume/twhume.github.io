<p>A Welsh primary school is <a href="http://www.newstatesman.co.uk/nma/nma2005/dispatches/archive/2005/01/21/child-prison/">considering tagging children</a>: "<i>Under the proposed system, an alarm sounds if any of the 350-pupils leave Ysgol Gynradd Gymraeg Lonlas Primary School, Swansea, at any point during the day.</i>"</p>

<p>Hmm.. "<i>The school has had trouble finding teaching assistants due to low pay and unfavourable working hours</i>". Well,  I can see a solution that doesn't involve infringing civil liberties and paying for equipment and maintenance to bring about a system that harms the children ("<i>children suffering bullying or accidents will have less protection than before</i>")... why not increase pay for classroom assistants?</p>

<p>As an aside, I wonder how they plan to attach these tags to children?</p>
