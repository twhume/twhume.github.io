<p>This morning I reached a particularly unpleasant milestone, and received what I *think* is the first spam email I've ever had explicitly advertising child pornography (maybe there have been others, but the spam filters caught them if so).</p>

<p>Bizarrely, it even includes a telephone number and postal address... But with a little investigation the spam looks like the work of <a href="http://www.stopkane.info/">this guy</a> - i.e. it's an attempt to frame someone rather than a genuine advert.</p>
