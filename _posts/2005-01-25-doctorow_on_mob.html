<p>Cory Doctorow, succinctly <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=101373&ref=bf1b93e66a7fec52283ca112ca4db6d4::6463">sums up mobile DRM</a>: "<i>Well, locomotives didn't require horseshoes. You know, the blacksmiths might not have liked the fact that locomotives didn't require horseshoes. But if you started a business to outfit locomotives with special horseshoes in order to keep the blacksmiths happy, you probably wouldn't have lasted very long. Likewise, if you're starting a business to outfit phones with special locks that make it hard to copy things in order to make the music industry happy, then you're probably not long for this world. </i>"</p>
