<p>Mark@<a href="http://www.fjord.co.uk/">Fjord</a> (who's just started blogging, by the way) has <a href="http://letterstoamerica.blogs.com/distraction_culture/2005/01/deaf_phones.html">an interesting post</a> about why people talk loudly on their phones in public: "<i>...we tend to moderate our volume by ambient noise (loud on a train for instance) and how well we can hear our interlocutor, which of course does not bear on how well they can hear us</i>"</p>
