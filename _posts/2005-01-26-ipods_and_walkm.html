<p><a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=20935">Dell CEO calls iPod a fad</a>: "<i>When the Walkman arrived in 1980 it changed everything. Music became portable. For those of us not dumb, arrogant, tasteless or brave enough to carry a giant boom-box around on our skinny, teenage shoulders the Walkman was a technological marvel.</i>"</p>

<p>His comparison between Apple and Dell is pretty interesting too... Apple are 2.4bn compared to Dells 13.5bn. Hmm, OK so that's 17% of the size, but hardly orders-of-magnitude less. Shit, <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">we</a> compete (and occasionally win out) against companies more than 5 times our size, so I think Mr Rollins is being a tad dismissive...</p>
