<p>Links that have been stuck in my copy of NetNewsWire for far too long and need to be expunged without comment:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/001207.html">How to be creative</a>
<li> <a href="http://www.uiweb.com/issues/issue28.htm">How to manage smart people</a>
<li> <a href="http://users.pandora.be/ptuui/">Bunny suicides</a>
<li> <a href="http://www.aikidojournal.com/?id=458">US Army hand-to-hand combat manual</a> looking very jujitsu like, and a rather blunt reminder of the sharp pointy end where some of our hobbies originated
</ul>
