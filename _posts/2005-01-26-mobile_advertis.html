<p>Is this wishful thinking? The same thing was said about the fixed-line internet: that we were entering an age of one-to-one marketing, personalised and highly targeted offers, and so on. Yet despite some notable exceptions (Amazon, Google Ads), what is the bulk of online advertising? Pop-ups, banner ads and email spam.</p>
