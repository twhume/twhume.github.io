<p><a href="http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/004248.php">Unusual objects for everyday life</a>: "<i>devices that rethink everyday digital devices and produce solutions that provide more meaningful and poetic interactions.</i>"</p>

<p><a href="http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/004262.php">When objects refuse to interact with their users</a>: "<i>...an alarm clock wakes up itself before waking up you, a selfish keyboard removes all the keys except the ones that tells you its name (qwerty) and a kitchen scale turns itself over and enjoys its own weight.</i>"</p>

<p>I've been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/3764365668/aeshinorg-20/ref%3Dnosim/202-4731648-6629460">Design Noir</a> recently on the recommendation of <a href="http://www.blackbeltjones.com/">Mr Jones</a>, and it's a fascinating book full of things like this: a new look at subversive electronic devices, alongside sometimes-hilarious childlike scrawlings. Go <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/3764365668/ref=sib_dp_pt/002-9956810-6885638#reader-page">have a peek</a>...</p>
