Most recently, Verizon Wireless has joined with a production company, Twentieth Television, to deliver direct-to-mobile shows as part of its new VCast service. The deal will also be extended to Verizon Wireless co-owner Vodafone&rsquo;s Live! platform outside the US. The TV company plans to produce 52 one-minute &lsquo;mobisodes&rsquo; of two original soap operas.</i>"</p>
