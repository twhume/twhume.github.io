<p><a href="http://blackbeltjones.typepad.com/work/2005/01/the_sim_of_achi.html">Via Mr Jones</a>, a post concerning games where <a href="http://www.gamegirladvance.com/archives/2005/01/27/peacecraft.html">peace, not conflict, is the aim</a>:</p>

<blockquote>"<i>Once we have a game system where the player is trying to maintain peace through a series of interesting choices (the same as one would make war in a typical Real Time Strategy), we can make things more complicated. What if the player not only needs to maintain peace, but also needs to be in a dominant position over the other players?</i>"</blockquote>

<p>One of the "aha" moments I belatedly had about 3-4 months after a group of us started playing Go, was the idea that efficiency is important in tallying up final scores: you get more points for capturing the maximum ground with minimal pieces. Or to put it another way (and given how err "undeveloped" my Go-playing skills are, I may be completely misunderstanding things): you win more by minimising direct conflict.</p>
