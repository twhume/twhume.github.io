<p><a href="http://www.ftrain.com/ThreeComputerGames.html">My Favourite Computer Games of 2004</a>: "<i>As you complete levels the razor gets more powerful and you have to be careful not to hurt the cats or neuter them. When you succeed in shaving a cat's balls, it spits up a diamond that you can collect. But when a cat escapes, it turns into a bandage, and if you trip  over the bandage, it wraps around you, and this keeps happening until you become a mummy, which scares the cats even more,  which makes them more difficult to find. Also, you're allergic to the sun, which means that during the day you have to open  up an umbrella, and different cats react in different ways to the umbrella. Some run away, and some turn into birch trees.</i>"</p>
