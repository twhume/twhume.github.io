<p><a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/archive/2005/01/30/the_message_tab.html">The answering machine desk</a>: "<i>When a message is left, a box representing that message slowly rises from the desk. The higher it rises, the longer the message. So when you return home, you know how many messages are waiting for you. To hear one, open the box's lid. Pushing that box back down into the desk deletes the message.</i>"</p>
