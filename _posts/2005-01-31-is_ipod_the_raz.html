<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20050127.html">Is iPod the Razor or the Blade?</a>: "<i>To me, it seems that Apple has reversed the relationship of razors and blades, and eliminated the loss leader role entirely. Apple makes very little money from selling songs, but it does make some profit. Apple makes a LOT of profit from selling iPods. So the song is the razor, not the iPod, and that's because the price sensitivity is currently about the content, not the player.</i>"</p>
