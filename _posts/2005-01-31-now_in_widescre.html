<p>I cracked and splashed out on a 20" Apple display for my Powerbook last weekend. Wow. I thoroughly recommend this to anyone who spends a significant chunk of their time at a desk with a laptop. Whilst I'd gotten used to the screen size of the 12" Powerbook, and Expose helps a great deal to mitigate the lower resolution, having this much extra screen space is fantastic... whether it be for writing proposals (keeping the requirements document open next to mine on-screen), or doing development work.</p>
