<p><a href="http://www.mobile-weblog.com/archives/ugly_duckling_starts_to_turn_into_swan.html">Levi's is launching a WAP campaign</a>: "<i>Mobile users will be able to watch a preview of the new Levi's commercial via Wap on February 7, a week before it is aired on television. Following this, a new campaign Wap site, to launch on February 11, will act as a hub for brand marketing activity and will be used to host promotions and mobile content. Users will be able to download a film and wallpapers.</i>"</p>

<p>The last pitch I ever worked on at <a href="http://www.goodtechnology.com/">GT</a> back in 2000 was the one which eventually brought in the Levi's Europe business - obviously we were talking about mobile back then, and it's great to see them doing something.</p>
