<p>I'm just waiting for someone to suggest routine video-monitoring of all classrooms. Panopticon, <a href="http://www.mobile-weblog.com/archives/thatll_teach_you.html">here we come</a>: "<i>These kids are starting to use Photoshop mash-ups to make it look as if teachers are hitting kids and the like. False accusation of teachers abusing kids is already a big problem in schools as the authorities have to take these accusations seriously. But if kids can convincingly fake evidence too, the problem is compounded.</i>"</p>
