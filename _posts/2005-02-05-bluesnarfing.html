<p>Bluesnarfing - someone's <a href="http://khurramfarooq.blogspot.com/2005/01/bluesnarfing-first-persons-perspective.html">had more luck getting Bloover to run than I</a>: "<i>It managed to get all the contacts in phone memory, all the contacts in the SIM card, all call logs (missed, dialled and received calls), all SMS (some were garbled with weird characters, but some of them even had his bank name, branch, account number and balance!). Blooover also managed to add a phone-entry of my own choosing, set the call forward to a default number, and initiated a call to another default number.</i>"</p>
