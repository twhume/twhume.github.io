<p>There was much oohing and aahing at <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">FP Towers</a> earlier this week, when we stumbled across <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000340030090/">this device</a>: a camcorder-mobile phone combo which appears to be only available in Japan. I'm not sure about how well the lopsided form factor works for day-to-day phone use, but the sheer inventiveness of it, and the cramming in of a traditional-looking video recorder, is fantastic.</p>
