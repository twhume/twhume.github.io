<p>Lovely quote from <a href="http://www.caterina.net/archive/000746.html">a post by Caterina Fake</a>, from an America admiral who was tortured during the Vietnam war: "<i>"This is a very important lesson. You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end&mdash;which you can never afford to lose&mdash;with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be."</i>"</p>
