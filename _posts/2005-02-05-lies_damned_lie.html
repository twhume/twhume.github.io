<p>The line between marketing and deliberate misinformation and deception <a href="http://www.site-9.com/blog/archives/000471.html">blurs once more</a>. Sigh... here we are, we have the majority of our populations permanently connected and contactable, we can store and retrieve massive amounts of data on behaviours, preferences and tendencies, and how are we sold to? By means of ham-fisted dishonesty and constant interruption.</p>
