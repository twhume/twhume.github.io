<p><a href="http://www.gamespy.com/articles/584/584744p1.html?fromint=1">Mind-Numbing New Interface Technologies</a>: "<i>Game interfaces often get the shaft. Developers invest tons in graphics or sound or physics, but nobody ever invests tons of time into the control scheme. Often people don't even really think about it. Game controllers are ubiquitous. You push a button, and stuff happens. But the interface is literally a player's connection to the game: it's where the action happens. </i>"</p>
