<p>Hmm, so <a href="http://www.moconews.net/index.php?p=1372">Cherrysauce is getting 1 million hits</a> to its (adult) mobile portal a month, eh, with 12-15% going onto charged services.</p>

<p>Well, that 12-15% conversation rate *is* encouraging, but 1m hits per month? That's not really very much, in the grand scheme of things - only 3 times as much traffic as this weblog gets! And as Russell points out, <a href="http://www.mobile-weblog.com/archives/adult_content_is_40_of_revenues.html">hits are a rubbish way of measuring traffic</a> anyway.</p>
