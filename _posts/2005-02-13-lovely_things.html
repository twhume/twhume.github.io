<p>Lovely things:</p>

<p>1. <a href="http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/004492.php">The knocking machine</a>: "<i>You put it on a table and knock on the table: the device detects the knock through a shock sensor in the bottom, copies and repeats it till you hold the hammer to stop it.</i>"</p>

<p>2. <a href="http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/004497.php">Beautiful barcodes</a> - that actually work.</p>

<p>3. <a href="http://www.marumushi.com/apps/flickrgraph/flickrgraph.cfm">FlickrGraph</a> - is there no end to the wonderful windows that Flickr users are opening onto that service?</p>

<p>4. <a href="http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/004513.php">Planes that never got built</a>.</p>

<p>5. <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/entry/1234000587031368/">Networked pac-man</a> - a lovely mod to the original game. Coincidentally, <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">we've</a> just implemented a similar sort of thing for a client using Bluetooth; maybe I'll be able to post about it one day...</p>
