<p><a href="http://www.joystiq.com/entry/1234000643029691/">Doom - the board game</a>. Wonderful, but I want more. I want to see multiplayer, on-paper games of Microsoft Office: format that paragraph! Throw 2 sixes to save successfully! Play your paperclip card for no reason other than to really fuck the other players off!</p>
