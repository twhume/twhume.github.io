<p><a href="http://blog.kordix.com/marv/archives/000400.html">How to use Napsters free trial to get 252 CDs of free music</a>; as I think I've written before, when any business faces off against the combined will of the worlds teenagers, my money is on the kids...</p>

<p>I mean, look a Microsoft: a software company. The Big One. And yet *they* suffer tremendously from piracy. If there was a technical solution, don't you think they'd have gotten onto it a few years back?</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Martin's pointed to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&storyID=7638153">this story</a>, which contains a lovely quote from the Napster folks:</p>

<p>"<i>The DRM (digital rights management) is intact. Basically, people are just recording off a sound card. This is nothing new and people could do this with any legitimate service if they want to use a sound card," she said.</i>"</p>

<p>Oh, that's OK then - I mean, the music's been stolen, but thank god the DRM is still intact!</p>
