<p>Some new images from the <a href="http://uiq.com/uiquserinterfaceimages">updated UIQ interface are here</a>. What strikes me about these is how desktop-like they are. Look - a menu bar, title, icons, pop-up dialogs...</p>

<p>I've never been a big fan of UIQ - producing an interface that relies on stabbing tiny portions of the screen seems to be a poor <a href="http://www.asktog.com/columns/022DesignedToGiveFitts.html">Fitts</a> (sorry) with styluses and mobile phones... we're used to painting and writing with less precise, broad strokes and that seems a better way to conduct everyday interactions (closing applications, making selections, firing off actions) than most of these handsets do today.</p>
