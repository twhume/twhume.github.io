<p>OK, here's the official invite to the <a href="http://e-democracy.org/brighton-hove">Brighton & Hove Issues Forum</a>. I'm ashamed to say that my involvement in this has been close-to-zero - i.e. turning up to an initial meeting and leaving early. But it's great to see this sort of thing actually happening: getting individuals engaging with government at the messy local level where Things Actually Happen.</p>

<p>"<i>I am part of a team which is launching a new web site for everyone in <br />
Brighton and Hove. It is going to be a place where everybody can talk about <br />
the issues that affect them, or interest them, to do with our City.</p>

<p>What are your views on the fight over plans for the new football stadium? <br />
What do you think about speed cameras? Are there problems with graffiti near <br />
you? Come and tell the forum, and together we can try to work out some <br />
solutions.</p>

<p>The forum is an independent project, run by volunteers whose only interest <br />
is to improve the working of local democracy. The city council and other <br />
local organisations will be watching what happens on the forum closely, so <br />
your voice might be heard by people with the power to make a difference.</p>

<p>We'd like you to be one of the first group of Brighton and Hove people that <br />
joins our new forum. It is easy to join. Sign-up on the web site now at:</p>

<p><a href="http://e-democracy.org/brighton-hove">http://e-democracy.org/brighton-hove</a></p>

<p>You can choose to participate via email or over the web. To take part, all <br />
you need is an email address and access to the web - available free at your <br />
local library. Please tell your friends about this new public forum.</i>"</p>
