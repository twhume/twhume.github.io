<p>Pen interfaces for handhelds are on the way out - <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000667031704/">apparently</a>. I'm not completely convinced myself - handset user interfaces are not a "solved problem", and there's still a great deal of work to be done (and innovation to see) in this area. Pen interfaces are not the same as handwriting recognition (Grafiti, anyone?) and as handsets get more complex, the limited bandwidth that tapping on a tiny keypad gives you into the device might become more, not less, of a problem.</p>
