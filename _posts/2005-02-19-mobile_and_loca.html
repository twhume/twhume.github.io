<p>Mmm, lovely mobile technology/local government crossover here - you can report problems with graffiti, fly tipping, etc. to Lewisham Council <a href="http://www.20six.co.uk/Cllr_Andrew_Brown/archive/2005/02/14/1p64l61lg1fqk.htm">through your cameraphone now</a>: "<i>The idea is that you download a programme that'll allow you to send photos from your mobile phone (or if you've got a digital camera from your computer desktop) to the council and then those are turned into a piece of casework.</i>"</p>
