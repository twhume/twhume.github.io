<p>Savaje are <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=21316">close to launching a handset</a> in 2005: "<i>Savaje aim to attack the mid tier sub $50 build price sector with its products. Let's hope they can make it.</i>".</p>

<p><a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">We</a> have no relationship with <a href="http://www.savaje.com/">Savaje</a>, but I'm keeping as close an eye as I can on what they're up to. The idea of opening up the whole mobile phone OS to be easily modified by third parties is mouth-watering for us.</p>
