<p>It's been synaesthesia week online:</p>

<ol>
<li> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4257961.stm">From the BBC</a>, "<i>A blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps.</i>"
<li> <a href="http://blackbeltjones.typepad.com/work/2005/02/practical_synas.html">Mr Jones on Mr Moore</a> and the idea of synaesthetic handset user interfaces: "<i>It would be wonderful to harness synasthesia in the UI of mobile devices. Going beyond multimedia output and multimodal interfaces - delivering meaning in Gladwellesque thin-slices of preattentive recognised patterns.</i>"
<li> <a href="http://foe.typepad.com/blog/2005/02/autism_and_nega.html">Mrs Jones on autism and synaesthesia</a>: "<i>When I multiply numbers together, I see two shapes. The image starts to change and evolve, and a third shape emerges. That's the answer. It's mental imagery. It's like maths without having to think.</i>"

<p>A few years ago I read the excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805071873/qid=1108843502/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/202-4731648-6629460">Blue Cats and Chartreuse Kittens</a>, a book on the subject (recommended). Interesting stuff, but I'd never even considered its relevance to work-stuff like user interfaces before...</p>
