<p>"<i>The attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, warned less than two weeks before the invasion of Iraq that military action could be ruled illegal.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>It appears that Lord Goldsmith never wrote an unequivocal formal legal opinion that the invasion was lawful, as demanded by Lord Boyce, chief of defence staff at the time.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Elizabeth Wilmshurst, deputy legal adviser at the Foreign Office, described the planned invasion of Iraq as a "crime of aggression".</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>What was served up to parliament as the view of the attorney general turned out to be the view of two of the closest aides of the prime minister</i>"</p>
