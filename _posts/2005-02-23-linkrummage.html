<p>Stuff that's piled up over the last few days, which I've not had time to write about:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.mobilecommunitydesign.com/archives/000108.php">mo:life</a>: "<i>a moderated email list focusing on mobile-media culture and technology</i>"
<li> <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/02/21/nokia_proximity_server/">Nokia enters the data dispenser biz</a>: "<i>At 3GSM last week, Nokia tiptoed into a market that one day might be enormous: the proximity server</i>"
<li> <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/02/21/worlddab_mobile_tv/">Who needs 3G?</a>: "<i>FM radio already comes as a 'free' piece of added value in some phones, so DAB now being a hell of a lot cooler, why not DAB, in the form of DMB? You could also view the radio roots as something of an advantage, given that we know people will listen to radio while they're moving, but we've yet to establish what the market for TV while moving actually is.</i>"
<li> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4287357.stm">'Friends fear' with lost mobiles</a>: "<i>People are becoming so dependent on their mobile phones that one in three are concerned that losing their phone would mean they lose their friends.</i>". It's true - your friends are the people who are so important to you that you *don't* know their numbers...
<li> <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">Ajax: a new approach to web applications</a> - well... "new" if you've not seen GMail, Flickr, and many others, but still a good article about what's going on under the hood. And talking of Flickr, <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/lpt/a/5607">here's</a> an interview with Stewart Butterfield.
<li> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4276255.stm">UK net users leading TV downloads</a> - and <a href="http://www.mobile-weblog.com/archives/is_tv_the_next_victim.html">more from Russ</a>. I guess the situation is blurred slightly by the BBC and license fees, no? I mean - isn't one of the drivers behind the IMPS project the idea that we own this programming already? Gah, Bittorrent is just a proto-Tivo for the rest of us anyhow - where's the line between videoing something that was on the TV last night and downloading it the next day, anyway?
<li> Mmm, <a href="http://ludology.org/article.php?story=20050222004941388">Tetris unplugged</a>...
<li> <a href="http://foe.typepad.com/blog/2005/02/things_that_tel.html">Foe Romeo on RFID toys</a>, and a piece on NTT DoCoMo's plans to <a href="http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/004612.php">use the human body as a network transmission path</a>.
<li> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4274811.stm">EU software patent law faces axe</a>: "<i>opponents of the bill said that it could stifle innovation, be abused by firms keen to protect existing monopolies and could hamper the growth of the open source movement.</i>"
<li> A good piece on <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/02/21/forgetting_digital_memories/">digital memories</a> which I want to print out, read, sit down and think about for an hour or two - one day: "<i>Hardly any of the potential consequences of our move to digital products and services are given a moment's thought.</i>". <a href="http://www.distractionculture.com/">Mark</a> has a lot to say about this. Or maybe <a href="http://letterstoamerica.blogs.com/agnes%20asleep.jpg">Agnes</a> does, I'm not sure.
<li> <a href="http://freelook.org/">FreeLook</a>: "<i>allows you to use movements of your head to accurately control your mouse cursor</i>"
</ul>
