<p><a href="http://www.lhtimes.com/bwinterviewmillar1.html">Interview</a> with one of the guys working on B&W2: "<i>The game now actually really changes depending on how you play the game! Isn&rsquo;t that cool? So if for example you are a warlike player the game will be more like that: the world will be full of armies and wars and actually you can win the land by kicking people&rsquo;s ass, by using force.</i>"</p>
