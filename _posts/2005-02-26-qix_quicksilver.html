<p>Ah great - it looks like someone has <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/archives/005280.html">done it</a>: produced a <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">QuickSilver</a>-like product for mobile phones. <a href="http://www.zicorp.com/qixfunctions.htm">Qix</a> "<i>ugments the phone interface by automatically presenting candidates to the user based on the data he or she inputs. The information used to generate candidates is sourced from a suite of different data stores on the phone</i>".</p>

<p>Where can I get a copy of this? The basic way in which I've interacted with a mobile phone - press a menu key, get options, or type in a number - hasn't changed since my <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,4879,128,00.html">first mobile</a> back in 1998/1999 (I was a late developer in mobile terms, and held off getting one for as long as possible). Just as QuickSilver completely changed the way I use my Mac, I'm looking forward to being able to hunt through the increasing amounts of Stuff on my phone in more efficient ways.</p>

<p>I see <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,1522,,00.html?orig=/lifeblog/">LifeBlog</a> as a prototype for this kind of thing: it does an excellent job of bringing together lots of sources of data and presenting them in a unified fashion, but it's about *reading*. Qix looks like it might go further than this, and let you not just read Stuff on your phone, but Do Things.</p>
