<p>Mobile radio: hmm, it might be <a href="http://www.anti-mega.com/antimega/archives/001161.html">fun for telecomms expats</a>, but until the commercial models are right (i.e. <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008339.html">flat rate data</a>) it's not viable for most of us. And of course, many phones have traditional FM radio receivers in them now, so it's not hard to imagine that they'll have DAB soon.</p>

<p>But overall this just seems like a missed opportunity: what can being on a mobile networked device add to radio? An awful lot, as it happens: interactivity, complementary content (bundled applications, video or graphics), interconnectivity between listeners, and links elsewhere ("hear more by this band").</p>

<p>IMHO the big wins aren't in funnelling radio over mobile networks, but rather about mobile augmenting and improving the radio experience...</p>
