<p>So the BPI are not only <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/archives/005256.html">suing people who don't know about or use filesharing</a>, they <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/03/04/bpi_fileshare_settlements/">seem</a> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4318765.stm">quite</a> <a href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/newmedia/story/0,7496,1430667,00.html">proud</a> of the fact too: "<i>We are going to continue bringing cases against people who distribute music illegally</i>"... that'll be the children, and the parents that "harbour" them, eh?</p>

<p>How should concerned parents react to this? Well, anyone who doesn't have time to educate themselves about internet usage or the ability to completely control their childrens behaviour should presumably avoid getting any sort of broadband, or face the threat of getting sued by the BPI. And despite what the BPI are saying, this isn't about "major filesharers" or "large-scale uploaders" - it's about individuals who happen to have 150 albums in their digital music collection. That doesn't seem very much to me: about 1.5GB isn't it? Maybe we should call for stop-and searches of anyone owning a digital music play of over 5GB capacity, to really crack down on these evil <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/11/17/graun_piracy_lessons/">terrorist-supporting</a> thieves?</p>

<p>And all this at a time when "<i>UK album sales have bucked the global trend by continuing to rise, adding to the debate over whether individuals illegally sharing songs online are detrimental to the industry</i>". I wonder how much sympathy or loyalty UK consumers will have for the music industry as increasingly difficult-to-track or control methods of filesharing emerge over the next few years?</p>
