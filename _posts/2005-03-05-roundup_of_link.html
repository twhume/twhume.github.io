<p>For various reasons, I anticipate that I shall be rather quiet for the next 4-6 weeks: work is about to step up a gear or three, and this will necessitate cutting back on not-work... So before that, a few links that have accumulated:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/oligrob/syncOtunes/syncOtunes.html">Synotunes</a> "<i>synchronizes your iTunes libraries</i>"
<li> <a href="http://www.g4tv.com/nintendodsday/features/49995/History_of_the_Handheld.html">History of the handheld</a>: Nintendos from the Game&Watch to the DS
<li> Take a look at this wonderful <a href="http://gprime.net/video.php/totalimmersion">augmented reality video</a>
<li> <a href="http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/004724.php">Robotic arm-wrestling!</a>
<li> <a href="http://www.shuffle-art.com/">ShuffleArt</a> - customise your iPod Shuffle
<li> Another <a href="http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/the-sims-2/591767p1.html?fromint=1">Will Wright interview</a>
<li> <a href="http://www.test.org.uk/archives/002375.html">The Physics of Hype</a>
<li> <a href="http://www.ifolder.com/index.html">iFolder</a> has released a Mac client at last - this looks really interesting for all sorts of stuff.
<li> <a href="http://recently.rainweb.net/hive/765/">Legalising TV torrents</a>. Ahem - is it me, or do other people find BitTorrent easier than programming a video to record?
<li> <a href="http://www.nisus.com/Thesaurus/">Nisus Thesaurus</a>
</ul>
