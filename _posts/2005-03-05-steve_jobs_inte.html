<p>Nice <a href="http://www.fortune.com/fortune/technology/articles/0,15114,1025093,00.html">Steve Jobs interview</a>: "<i>The place where Apple has been standing for the last two decades is exactly where computer technology and the consumer electronics markets are converging</i>".</p>

<p>This is coincidentally how I've long felt about my career: working on the web from 95-2000 and in mobile ever since, I've been fortunate enough to spend my time at the place where technology is meeting and merging with society.</p>

<p>God that sounds pretentious.</p>
