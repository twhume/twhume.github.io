<p>Wow - according to <a href="http://www.eet.com/sys/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleId=60405593">this interview</a> with a guy at Nokia who's probably spent waaay more time thinking about TV content than I have, what people really want on their mobiles are not designed-for-mobile bits of video, but full broadcast stuff - what they see on their TV day-to-day.</p>

<p>That goes completely against what <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/archives/000606.html">I've</a> <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/archives/004990.html">been</a> <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/archives/005780.html">anticipating</a>, and whilst I'm suspicious that his view may be focus group-driven (asking people what they want, not watching them to find out)... he's seen the research and I haven't.
