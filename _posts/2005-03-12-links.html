<p>Lists of links, with perhaps a pithy piece of sarcasm or a quote appended, are all I have time for this week:</p>

<ul>

<li> Lovely <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008354.html">mobile car ad campaign</a>. Kicking myself that we haven't been suggesting this...
<li> <a href="http://crystaltips.typepad.com/wonderland/2005/03/the_dating_game.html">Massively Multiplayer Online Dating Games</a>: "<i>A game specifically targeted to dating and socialising: as a dating service. Not as a game. Not as part of a game (SWG's character matching, etc). Not as a chat room, not as a Metaverse, not There.com but as a direct and simple service. Using a game environment in a serious - yet playful, very necessary for dating - way.&#160;</i>"
<li> <a href="http://www.lionhead.com/personal/mhealey/downloads.html">Rag Doll Kung Fu</a>
</ul>

<p>Hmm, 4 of the above directly relate to Stuff We Have On...</p>
