<p><a href="http://news.com.com/Meet+Mr.+I-mode/2008-1082_3-5559259.html?tag=st.prev">Interesting interview</a> with Kei-ichi Enoki, executive VP at NTT DoCoMo: "<i>Videoconferencing--this is part of your job. There is no preference to it; you have to do it whether you like it or not. We think that there is a market there, but that market itself will be small. If it goes to the consumers, I think that means a greater expansion of the market for us. But one issue is that you don't always want to use a TV phone. It is not an issue about technology; this is maybe more of a psychological issue.</i>"</p>
