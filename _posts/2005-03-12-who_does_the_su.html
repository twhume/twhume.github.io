<p><a href="http://www.adweek.com/aw/national/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000828049">Nice piece</a> about the "subservient chicken" online ad campaign which Burger King ran a while back. But, lovely tho it is to hear that it's generated 396 million hits, isn't it slightly worrying that the guy behind the campaign can offer only anecdotal results as to whether it actually led people to buy more chicken?</p>

<p>As the franchise owner in this story puts it, "It's difficult to show a causal relationship between sales and the advertising"</p>
