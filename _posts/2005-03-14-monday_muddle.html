<li> <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/entry/1234000070035817/">Using Flickr for moblogging games</a>: "<i>...people are going to start moblogging their virtual worlds just as much as the real world.</i>"<br />
<li> <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/online/archives/mobile_phones/2005/03/arpu_bless_you.html">Balls</a> from the Guardian blog, equating high ARPU with expensive. The analogy with petrol and cars just doesn't hold: high ARPU can be a result of extremely usable interfaces. For instance, I remember hearing a statistic a few years back that users of Nokia handsets texted twice as much as users of other handset - and this was put down to the usability of the product.<br />
<li> The Friday-Ad (Sussex's answer to <a href="http://www.loot.com/">Loot</a>) seems to <a href="http://www.nma.co.uk/Document.aspx?did=1b15a7e1-f44d-4a4f-aa61-c0cbcb5acca9">get mobile</a>. And their content is perfect: bite-size chunks of gloriously unsexy advertising that *really matters to real people*.<br />
<li> The <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1775487,00.asp">new game</a> from Will Wright: "<i>Spore could end up being quite literally the biggest and most ambitious game ever attempted. Although it begins at the microscopic level, with players taking control of a monocellular organism in a tidal pool, the scale changes as the creature evolves and grows. The end result: A massive adventure spanning an entire galaxy with player-driven gameplay and design shared seamlessly online among the entire Spore community.</i>"<br />
<li> <a href="http://smlxtralarge.com/archives/000130.php">Changes in advertising</a>: "<i>they may well start to divert their advertising dollars away from TV broadcast if thet feel this medium becomes less effective</i>". Presumably if an even half-effective, vaguely accountable form of advertising became available, it would get adopted in favour of some of what we have today.<br />
<li> The US is <a href="http://www.imodestrategy.com/2005/03/us_mobile_game_.html">ripe for mobile gaming</a>: "<i>(1) the larger population and (2) the percentage of game content is already much larger on mobile in the US than the percentage in Japan.</i>"<br />
