<p><a href="http://mobhappy.typepad.com/russell_buckleys_mobhappy/2005/09/_ctia_all_your_.html">All Your Base Belong to Amp'd</a>: "<i>Its target market is 18- to 35-year-olds, and the stuff it's got lined up should be wide and deep enough to satisfy the whole range: lots of video (streaming and download), music, tons of games and so on. The phone ships as a blank slate, essentially, and users set it up via the Amp'd Web site to make it appear exactly as they want.</i>"</p>

<p>I first heard about Amp'D at BREW2005 this year and they sound a bit different from your run-of-the-mill carriers... but are founded by a guy who's kicked off umpteen MVNOs. One to watch.</p>
