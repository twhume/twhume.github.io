<a href="http://www.cyberjournalist.net/news/002930.php">BBC News to launch new reader comment system</a>: "<i>The BBC is moving to the new system because the site is currently overwhelmed by the volume of submissions, as every comment currently has to be individually approved before being published.</i>"

Good to see the beeb taking a bit of a stand here. Requirements that some online (and mobile) organisations mandate are pretty crazy, and driven more by fear of prosecution than desire to protect, from what I've seen.
