<li> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4265220.stm">Long battery life is vital</a>; I'm convinced that advances in battery or power transmission technologies are what will really revolutionise mobile. So many aspects of it are tied to assumptions of limited or low power that when those assumptions can be removed or weakened, a whole range of new opportunities open up.
<li> <a href="http://www.mobileuserexperience.com/?p=122">Are handsets suitable for e-books</a>? Yes they are. We're working on an e-book project right now for a client of ours. Interesting stuff, I'll write more when I can.
<li> Oliver reckons wi-fi in handsets will <a href="http://www.mobile-weblog.com/50226711/will_wifi_free_handset_manufacturers_from_carrier_servitude.php">free handset vendors from carrier dominance</a>. My take? It'll also free them from having any customers. Carriers don't just build the roads, they service the vehicles and subsidise them for the mass market, then sell the petrol to drivers.
