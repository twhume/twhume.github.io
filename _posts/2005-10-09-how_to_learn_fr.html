<p><a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/essays/essay44.htm">How to learn from your mistakes</a>: "<i>We&rsquo;re taught in school, in our families, or at work to feel guilty about failure and to do whatever we can to avoid mistakes. This sense of shame combined with the inevitability of setbacks when attempting difficult things explains why many people give up on their goals: they&rsquo;re not prepared for the mistakes and failures they&rsquo;ll face on their way to what they want. What&rsquo;s missing in many people&rsquo;s beliefs about success is the fact that the more challenging the goal, the more frequent and difficult setbacks will be.</i>"<br />
