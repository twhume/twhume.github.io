<p>My god - NetNewsWire is creaking under the strain of a couple of hundred tabs, so here's an attempt to empty a few. First a StatBurst:</p>

<ul>
<li> There are now <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=26253">2 billion mobiles worldwide</a>, and "<i>the bulk of the new growth now is coming from large, less well-developed markets such as China, India, Eastern Europe, Latin America and Africa</i>"
<li> 4 million people are <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/09/19/vodafone_3g/">using Vodafone 3G</a>, with faster HSDPA networks scheduled for next year;
<li> <a href="http://mobhappy.typepad.com/russell_buckleys_mobhappy/2005/09/just_17_of_uk_s.html">Apparently</a> "<i>just 17% of UK mobile phone owners use their devices for anything other than texting and calling -- on a daily basis</i>". So nearly 1 in 5 UK adults are making use of some sort of advanced data service on their phones, daily. Nice - and plenty of room for growth;
<li> WiMax projections <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008635.html">seem to show it isn't a 3G killer</a>, film at 11. That doesn't mean it isn't important, of course.... just that Skype-using PocketPC owners won't be burning down Vodafone just yet;
</ul>
