<a href="http://technology.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,16559,1586891,00.html?gusrc=rss">Young blog their way to a publishing revolution</a>: "<i>...a third of all young people online have launched their own blog or website.</i>"

I also liked the idea that "<i>rather than using the internet as their parents do - as an information source, to shop or to read newspapers online - most young people are using it to communicate with one another.</i>". Wonderful.
