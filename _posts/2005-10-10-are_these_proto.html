<p>Are <a href="http://www.mobile-weblog.com/50226711/the_future_as_seen_by_nokia.php">these prototypes</a> really all that interesting? Phones that are jewellery,  phones that are all screen, curved devices, thin devices... a lot of this stuff isn't speculation, it's <a href="http://www.au.kddi.com/au_design_project/seihin/talby/">nigh-there</a>, and I would imagine that there's much more interesting stuff lurking in the depths of Nokia than this.</p>

<p>Me? I want to know what happens to us as a society when the third world get the sort of mobile penetration we are fortunate enough to have now - when the starving can communicate directly with the well-fed, say.</p>
