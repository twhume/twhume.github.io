<p>Time to brush up my public speaking - I'm going to be at a couple of events in November.</p>

<p>On the 11th, here in sunny Brighton, I'm going to be at <a href="http://www.clearleft.com/services/training/dconstruct.php">dConstruct 2005</a> blathering on about the mobile web, shouting at all these terribly fashionable Web 2.0 types that they're looking in the wrong direction and the humble mobile shall be pissing on their chips over the next few years.</p>

<p>Presuming I make it out of there alive, the next week I'm at <a href="http://www.worldtelemedia.co.uk/">World Telemedia</a> in Amsterdam to present a case study on the work we've been doing for <a href="http://www.puzzlermedia.com/">Puzzler Media</a>: how you launch a portfolio of casual games in the national press, priced well below any other mobile game offering in the UK, and what you learn when you do this.</p>
