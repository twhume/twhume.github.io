<p>How well has <a href="http://www.mobileuserexperience.com/?p=128">Series 60 done as a licensed platform</a>? "<i>The SX1 isn&rsquo;t actively sold any more and is shown as discontinued on some online stores. It wasn&rsquo;t ever followed by an updated model and I guess Siemens lost its way due the competition from Nokia&rsquo;s own Series 60 phones.</i>"</p>

<p>When Nokia first kicked off S60 as a brand, there was a lot of noise about other handset vendors licensing the platform and building their own Series 60 devices. They say <a href="http://series60.com/?action=showPage&pbId=21&pbType=-1&c_id=6&company=Nokia">they've launched 26 Series 60 handsets</a> - are licensees still stepping up to use the platform?</p>
