<p>Slight touch of professional jealousy here - the <a href="http://www.itv.com/page.asp?partid=4325">ITV Mobizines</a> service looks gorgeous. On my 6680 it installs Flash and a lovely-looking Flash movie which updates content over time; on other handsets it's a Java app and there's a supporting WAP site too.</p>
