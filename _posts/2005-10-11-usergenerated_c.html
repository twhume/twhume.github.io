<p><a href="http://mobhappy.typepad.com/russell_buckleys_mobhappy/2005/10/encouraging_use.html">User-generated content</a>: "<i> Basically users can register content they create by sending it to a special short code where it gets tagged, then can pass it on to their friends. Carriers can then keep track of how many times it gets forwarded, presumably building in some sort of reward system where people that create compelling content get rewarded if it gets passed around.</i>"</p>

<p>I think I've worked out what bothers me about the phrase "user-generated content": it's been championed by the proponents of "content is king", when actually what "user-generated content" is is all the stuff that these proponents don't own: it's communication on a personal level.</p>

<p>So these guys are redefining personal communication to be something that's part of their business, something that they own. Yuck. Or am I just being paranoid?<br />
