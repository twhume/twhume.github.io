<p>I'm not sure I buy <a href="http://www.imodestrategy.com/2005/10/mike_gauba_why_.html">this</a> (too many buzzwords for me - "synergizing the application and hardware to maximize user value" indeed!), but it's an interesting argument: "<i>The convergence of diverse services dilutes the focus on each service, thus leaving it to struggle.</i>"</p>

<p>So, stepping back from the grand strategies and focusing on more tactical stuff... how do you ensure that an increasingly multipurpose device doesn't end up as a jack of all trades, master of none? Or (he says, eyeing the PC suspiciously) does it matter if it does?<br />
