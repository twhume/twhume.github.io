By Christ it scared me. Have they learned nothing from the Silver Surfer?<br /><br />Even if I-mode is "faster than WAP", does this really matter? Does associating I-mode with WAP generate any sort of resonance with customers? Are the public at large sitting at home desperately wishing that WAP were faster? I think not.<br /><br />Coincidentally, yesterday I paid a visit to some <a href="http://www.mmo2.co.uk">chums in Slough</a> and saw I-mode for the first time, and it looks very interesting. I can't put my finger on why - the whole just seems like more than the sum of it's parts. And they've managed to get a <a href="http://shop.o2.co.uk/shop/o2uk/jsp/handset/ViewHandset.do?menu=y&prodID=consumer:NEC:343i:IMODE:GROUP">decent-looking handset</a> out of NEC, which is massively impressive too.<br /><br />I'm NDAd so can't talk about one of the aspects of it that really got me excited, but the I-Mail product - which I believe will let content providers message I-mode customers using email and avoiding per-message charges - knocks aside one of the fundamental assumptions us mobile folks make when we're thinking of services and opens up a whole raft of opportunities.<br /><br />Even if I-mode itself doesn't generate massive subscriber levels, it might push the rest of the UK mobile industry in the right direction.<br clear="all" />
