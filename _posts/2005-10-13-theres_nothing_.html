I thought I'd blogged this when I first saw it (and hey maybe I had), but a conversation with <a href="http://www.distractionculture.com/">Mark</a> yesterday brought up <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/51971650/">this photo</a> which I took earlier this year at the Bradford Museum of Photography. It's a series of 1920s Cameras For Girls but what struck me was the ipoddity of these hand-crafted beauties...
