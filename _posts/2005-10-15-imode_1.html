<p>So, after being given the run-through last week (and oohing and aahing at the NEC N343i, "<a href="http://www.idiottoys.com/2005/10/nec-n343i-our-new-gay-phone.html">the gayest phone we've ever seen</a>") I popped into town and picked up a handset today. I'll record my impressions here and update the post over time.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/52660995/" title="photo sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/24/52660995_5786de92d1_m.jpg" alt="" style="border: solid 2px #000000;" /></a> <br /> <span style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 0px;"> </span></div>The packaging is good. Lots of I-mode promotion there, all focused around the benefits that I-mode can bring. None of this "faster than WAP" rubbish.

<p>Took handset out of box, plugged in battery and charger. The SIM was already in there. Turned it on, pressed the "I-mode" button. <b>It just worked</b> - I've not had to activate my SIM or anything yet, and I can browse the I-mode portal. That's very nice.</p>

<p>I-mode does indeed seem quick (though services provided by content providers are slightly slower than the I-mode menu itself - which is to be expected I suppose). I'd like to know how; I don't buy the cHTML-is-faster-than-WML argument, it's going over the same networks as WAP does. Maybe the lack of a WAP proxy speeds things? Pages with images on them are noticeably slower - maybe the bundling of e-moji icons onto the handset itself lets O2 provide a faster portal experience.</p>

<p>The NME service seems to be full of dodgy &#244; character encoding rubbish - more QA needed there, and no real excuse given that there's only a few I-mode handsets on the market right now.</p>

<div style="float: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/52661371/" title="photo sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/24/52661371_0044094c1b_m.jpg" alt="" style="border: solid 2px #000000;" /></a> <br /> <span style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 0px;"> </span></div>The content provider services seem to have their own "character", though they seem mainly to be based around ringtone and image downloads (fair enough I guess). They seem to be based around their own "currency" systems - i.e. I subscribe to the Disney Channel and then get a certain number of "credits" to spend with them each month. I guess this relies on consumers keeping track of how many credits they've spent with various providers. Subscriptions are free until December, it appears, and subscribing is an easy process.

<p>There's a rich portfolio of games. The mobile Sudoku provided by G-Mode is pretty average, but playable.</p>

<p>NEC need help with their UI work in Europe. I like the external appearance of the handset but using it to send text messages is painful. There are actually 2 completely different messaging menus - one you get by pressing the lovely envelope button, the other by navigating to "messages".</p>

<p>So overall: I-mode looks lovely and I'm impressed, but I suspect they'll need to roll out a better overall UI for their handset for this to really take off.</p>
