<p><a href="http://www.ok-cancel.com/archives/article/2005/10/the-end-of-wysiwyg.html">The end of WYSIWYG?</a>: "<i>There is also live-previewing which allows people to easily try permutations and options without having to commit changes</i>"</p>

<p>This sounds interesting; lots of apps already do it, of course, but it seems that with processing power on the desktop having improved massively over the last 10 years, it's ripe to be rolled into the UI as a general principle... in many ways GUIs were the same, there were people doing WIMP interfaces with character-based displays back in the day, well before Windows/GEM/etc did it.<br />
