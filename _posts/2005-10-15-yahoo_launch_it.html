<p><a href="http://www.imodestrategy.com/2005/10/yahoo_launch_it.html">Yahoo launch its own billing solution</a>: "<i>It means they can now provide full access, content and billing to end users independently from carriers.</i>"</p>

<p>I've heard of other alternative billing systems to those provided by DoCoMo, which let unofficial content get charged out. Has anyone actually seen them in action?</p>
