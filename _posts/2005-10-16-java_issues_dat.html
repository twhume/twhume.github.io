<p><a href="http://www.mobilestartup.com/mt/archives/2005/10/buried.html">This</a> sounds interesting: "<i>we are going to be providing a known issues database where we will track known bugs and issues of the various phones; mostly Java and BREW to start. </i>"</p>

<p>I'll confess slight scepticism as to how <a href="http://www.mobileresearch.net/">Mobile Research</a> will compete with <a href="http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/">WURFL</a> and its offshoots, but the idea of a public bug database for handsets is a very compelling one (I think <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/">Richard</a> may have proposed it a while back)... all too often we're having to scratch around to determine whether bizarre behaviour is a handset issue, and having some sort of source to check this (and maybe locate workarounds?) would be very helpful.</p>
