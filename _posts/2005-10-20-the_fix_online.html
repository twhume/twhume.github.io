<p><a href="http://www.thefixonline.com/ezine.php#381">The Fix Online</a> urge you to send banal postcards to dictators: "<i>anyone can send a letter to a dictator saying how dare you do this to fellow humans you disgusting man/men etc,etc&#8230;. The UN can try them in the war crimes court but if you really want to get to them. Really punish them, then you need to send them banal postcards for no reason.</i>"<br />
