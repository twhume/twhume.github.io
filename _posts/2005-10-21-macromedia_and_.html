<p>Macromedia seem to have shifted up its mobile plans a gear - first with the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/10/19/macromedia_qualcomm/">BREW/Flash announcement</a> (though I note that it's early days and they're not planning a launch until "next year"), and then with their acquisition of <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=27095">Mobile Innovations</a>.</p>
