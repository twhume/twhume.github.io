<p><a href="http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/news/item/Whoopah_Freeware_support_from_Nokia.php">Whoopah! Freeware support from Symbian</a>: "<i>As of today, all freeware developers of Series 60, 80 and 90 and UIQ&#160; applications can have their applications Symbian Signed for free, courtesy of Symbian nd its partners, who are eager to promote freeware and the growth of the application catalogs for their platforms.</i>"</p>

<p>Better than nothing; but what this means is that whilst large software developers (who can afford keys) and folks working on freeware are welcomed by Symbian, the guys being discriminated against are the smaller commercial developers.<br />
