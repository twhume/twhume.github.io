<p><a href="http://www.imodestrategy.com/2005/10/_051023_weekly_.html#51023-1">O2 lead for mobile data</a>: "<i>O2, which itself launched i-mode in October 2005, is the leading European operator for data ARPU. It generated data ARPU of US$11.8 in the UK in Q2 2005. The operator's high data revenues are achieved mainly through to its market leadership in messaging (more than 40% of UK SMS originate from an O2 subscriber).</i>"</p>

<p>Yep - we see a disproportionate amount of traffic to a service which isn't currently promoted via any operator portal, all from O2.</p>
