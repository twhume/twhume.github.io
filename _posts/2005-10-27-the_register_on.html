<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/10/26/review_nec_n411i_i-mode/">El Reg on I-mode</a>: "<i>There's no denying that i-mode is great. I love the way it works, the selection of content, the pricing structure, the speed of access and the bundled push email. Unfortunately, the NEC N411i just feels a little behind the times in today's world of super stylish and fully featured mobiles. NEC should be congratulated for getting i-mode handsets out so quickly, but something tells me that we'll be seeing far better examples in the near future.</i>"</p>

<p>What can I say, other than +1</p>
