<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4392662.stm">BSkyB in Vodafone mobile TV deal</a>: "<i>Sky Mobile TV will allow Vodafone customers to view some of BSkyB's TV content on their third generation (3G) handsets from Tuesday.</i>"</p>

<p>And <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/10/31/vodafone_sky/">apparently</a> "<i>This is not a trial on a very limited number of phones or a service available on a single make of mobile, but something that all our Vodafone live! with 3G customers can experience.</i>"</p>

<p>&pound;5 a month sounds very low. I wonder how the networks will manage to support large numbers of viewers simultaneously - or have they gotten their act together with multicast now?</p>
