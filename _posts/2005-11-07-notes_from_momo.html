<p>By popular demand - apologies for stream of consciousness notes and any sarcasm/rudeness I wrote for my own benefit and have forgotten to strip out.</p>

<p>First up: <b>Dennis Hettema (OP3) on ShotCode</b>:</p>

<p>Offline-online connections: "Connect consumers on impulse"</p>

<p>1. decodes on-device<br><br />
2. server routes to server? not sure what's happening here<br><br />
3. content optimised blah blah</p>

<p>Not particularly new or unusual service (for this audience anyway) - maybe I'm a spoilt bastard.</p>

<p>Spoke about a "business card replacement application": in 8hrs 1200 "information exchanges". This relied on installing software through WAP push, they're working on "some sort of standard open source" version</p>

<p>See shotcode.com</p>

<p>Then he passed around a shotcode and I gave it a go - it worked really well.</p>

<p><b>Richard Jelbert (KidsOK LBS)</b></p>

<p>Experiences rolling out into retail</p>

<p>- Cell ID<br><br />
- Enhanced Cell ID<br><br />
- Assisted GPS</p>

<p>Active services: user-actioned<br><br />
Passive services: involves much more regulation<br><br />
Hybrid services: like what?</p>

<p>In: MSISDN+network<br><br />
Out: Lat/long+accuracy (+landmarks? postcodes? address descriptions?)</p>

<p>Every app needs approval from all (4?) operators</p>

<p>Code of practice (voluntary): regulates any service locating a SIM using a network (even corporate services)</p>

<p>Took 9 months to develop (should've been 3)</p>

<p>4 categories of service:</p>

<p>- corporate<br><br />
- friend finder<br><br />
- children<br><br />
- gaming</p>

<p>CoP cornerstones<br><br />
- address validation<br><br />
- confirm physical access to that address (activation letter)<br><br />
- opt in all handsets<br><br />
- any time STOP<br><br />
- transparency on activity (so a child can find out how many times they've been located etc etc)</p>

<p>KidsOK:<br><br />
- wraps up mapping, tracking<br><br />
- one of the only providers with a product in retail (usual story: packaging with a code in it)<br><br />
- long registration process: 12-20 minutes<br><br />
- then activation letter. some accounts never activated. confusing opt-in, product seems complicated<br><br />
- 48% registrants do not activate<br><br />
- 48% of activations don't then opt in<br><br />
- <10k child location users in the UK (30k+ Korea, 50k+ S.Africa)<br></p>

<p>Code of practice only covers operator based LBS (not GPS ones or those based on other triangulation which don't access location feeds directly)<br></p>

<p>KidsOK about to release a GPS childs phone, introduced under "core principles of code of practice"<br></p>

<p>LBS to route calls/messages to local franchises (pizza etc?)</p>

<p>Dan: UE issues seem to come from use of SMS as a bearer. Have you considered using a Java application?<br><br />
Richard: Potentially causes delays in the approval process</p>

<p>Carl Taylor: What will be a simple revenue-generating LBS app? KidsOK seems to be protected v few children.<br><br />
Richard: Works better when the child can alert the parent (not sure why this would be the case)</p>

<p><b>Chris Yanda (BBC, Coast Project)</b></p>

<p>Explored LBS. Put signs up instead.<br />
Coast: broadcast starting July 22nd, exploring coastal locations around UK<br />
Wanted to give people a reason to see these locations.<br />
LBS services are patchy: what works in London doesn't necessarily work elsewhere. Signs reassure folks.<br />
Regional websites each included a single coastal walk: where they could put up signs. 8 signs per walk.<br />
Each sign had a number of mobile interactions: IVR, WAP site (v v popular). (Image was important for giving a bit of context) Mystery quiz for kids.</p>

<p>Struggle: weird physical practicalities. Wanted a data code on a sign, plus other things, plus how big should sign be, how high, put where. Sign had to be at 7 feet. Holding a child up at 7 feet with camera presented usability issues.</p>

<p>IVR service wasn't used much: mainly due to huge up-front T&Cs. Few people bothered digging through it all.</p>

<p>4000 people tried the data codes (only available for S60).<br />
309 successfully downloaded it (most people ignored the "it's not for your device" msg).</p>

<p>Audio was most successful because it worked for everyone - all phones. Liked cos it's much like a museum guide.</p>

<p>0800 aren't free on mobile, so they used 0870. A pressure group called "just say no to 0870" complained. Had to go to Ofcom to smooth it over.<br />
Treasure hunt for kids was popular.<br />
WAP site was v popular: weather info, useful  numbers.<br />
Low signs more popular. You look less silly.</p>

<p>137,000 requests over last 3 months </p>
