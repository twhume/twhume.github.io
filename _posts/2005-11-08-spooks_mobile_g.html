<p>Via "Lady Fifibelle" on UK-WirelessMarketing, <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,1635220,00.html"></a>: "<i>According to Jamie Cason, executive producer at BBCi, which commissions the work, the project, which has cost &pound;100,000 of licence-fee money, is 'extending the reach of TV shows' and 'exploring the different ways in which people engage with TV'.</i>"</p>

<p>I had a play of the game after watching the show last week, and whilst it's quite impressive, &pound;100k seems... err "generous" ;)</p>
