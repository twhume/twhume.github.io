<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/11/08/docomo_buys_tower/">NTT DoCoMo buys music retail chain</a>: "<i>DoCoMo will initially provide Tower's 100 Japanese stores with pay-by-phone systems allowing consumers to purchase music and have it billed to their FeliCa mobile phone accounts.</p>

<p>Both firms also said they are considering a digital music download service partnership, and that's likely to be the real motivation behind the deal. DoCoMo gains a music brand and knowledge needed to provide such a service which could integrate perfectly with the telco's i-mode facility. Some reports claim music accounts for around half of all i-mode content sales.</i>"</p>

<p>Also worth considering: catalogue shopping via mobile is, I'm told, Big In Japan. CDs much surely be an in-demand item and suitable for such things.</p>
