<p>My turn at <a href="http://www.dconstruct.org/">d.Construct</a> went OK... "ish". After some embarrassing initial setup problems (a pox on Powerbooks and dual displays - I had it working before I left the office!) I rambled a bit; I could have done with more preparation and a run-through. But on a positive note my fears of running far too short were completely unfounded: the timer on Keynote revealed that I hit the 45 minute mark exactly. So I really *can* blather on about this stuff for hours.</p>

<p>I need more practice at this sort of thing - it's been about 2 years since I last did any public speaking. And about 4 hours until the next one, at dScape ;) But they're both warmups for the presentation on our work for Puzzler which I'm delivering at <a href="http://www.wtevent.co.uk/">World Telemedia</a> next week...</p>

<p>A couple of folks <a href="http://www.timandkathy.co.uk/journal/2005/11/11/tom-hume-web-everywhere/">have</a> <a href="http://www.zachinglis.com/conference/dconstruct/dconstruct-live-part-2/">notes</a> from my talk - <a href="http://tomhume.typepad.com/d.Construct-2005.pdf">here</a> are the slides. I hear tell there may be a PodCast at some point too...</p>
