<p>OK, Netnewswire is getting jam-packed with tabs, so time to rid myself of things I planned to write about but will obviously never get round to:</p>

<ul>
<li> Write-up of a <a href="http://www.thisismobility.com/blog/?p=44">US MoMo meeting</a> themed around search;
<li> Russ <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008648.html">on a few things</a>, casual multiplayer games about them: "<i>I wonder if anyone&rsquo;s made a multi-player Suduko yet?</i>". No comment ;)
<li> The <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/a_streamlined_remote_from_apple.php">Apple remote</a>; very interesting, one of the things I've been waiting for for a while now. As Apple embed themselves deeper and deeper into the living room, this becomes ever more important.
<li> <a href="http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/2005/10/010259.htm">Splashpower</a>; I've <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2005/10/flashmobilinkmo.html">said it before</a> - power distribution is one of those areas where we're due a revolution, which'll undermine so many of the assumptions which underpin the design of consumer electronics.
<li> <a href="http://mobhappy.typepad.com/russell_buckleys_mobhappy/2005/10/shozu_your_phot.html">Shozu</a> is fab - great for impulse-posting of photos. An operator should release it to one of their heavy data use customer segments, with each photo being 400k it'll make a big difference to traffic. Shame my 6680 keeps running out of bloody memory - 30% of the time when I take a photo it refuses to save it nowadays, which is completely unacceptable. Time to upgrade I guess...
<li> <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/should_calendars_online_look_like_calendars_offline.php">Should calendars online look like calendars offline?</a>
<li> <a href="http://cognections.typepad.com/lifeblog/2005/09/transcoding_sit.html">Transcoding web sites</a> to WAP isn't a panacea. Nope - the things you want to put onto mobile in the first place are different. It's not just a question of fooling with the markup.
<li> <a href="http://mobiledesign.org/">10 reasons to publish to mobile</a>
<li> An <a href="http://www.qualcomm.com/enterprise/pdf/WhyMAX_JBelk.pdf">excellent Qualcomm paper</a> debunking WiMax as a competitor to existing mobile networks.
<li> The ITV MobZine I <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2005/10/mobizines.html">wrote about</a> a while back is an excellent application, but I disabled mine after getting fed up of it <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=27151">waking me in the morning</a> and disturbing me in the afternoon.
