<p>I just upgraded to a <a href="http://www.nokia.com/n70">Nokia N70</a> yesterday. Is it me, or does pressing the red STOP key when you're running a Java app kill said app? It used to be that this would place it into the background where it would continue running - nowadays you can only background such an app by manually switching back to "phone" using the menu key.</p>

<p>Slightly annoying if so. We've done a couple of Java apps this year that benefit from being run in-the-background...</p>

<p>Other impressions of the phone:</p>

<p>Camera and image management are both more complicated, and the keypad shortcodes I used to use ("1" to activate night mode, etc.) no longer work. Not sure why - it's not like those keys are used for anything else instead.</p>

<p>The gallery app is awful. I *loved* the old "image viewer" on my 6680, it made scanning through pictures a joy (using full-screen mode). The current gallery seems to insist that I set up a slideshow and choose some accompanying music before I can view my pictures - yuck.</p>

<p>The Orange-supplied icons are too spindly, not solid and clear enough.</p>

<p>Fonts are weird, particularly in J2ME and the browser.</p>

<p>The handset seems faster, and memory issues on the 6680 (made worse by Orange Homescreen and iSync Agent) don't seem to have recurred yet, I appear to have about 30mb of RAM to play with which should keep the pressure off for a while.</p>
