<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/11/14/o2_interims/">O2 ups revs and punters</a>: "<i>The UK-based cellco's total number of customers stood at 25.7m - up 17 per cent compared to last year - thanks in part to a 34 per cent jump in numbers in Germany. But customer numbers were also buoyed by O2's ability to hold onto existing punters and stop them from switching cellcos.</i>"</p>

<p>Not only this. O2s customer base has a <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2005/10/o2_lead_for_mob.html">predisposition towards using mobile data</a> unrivalled by other operators.</p>
