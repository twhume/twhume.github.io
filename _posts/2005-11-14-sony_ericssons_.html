<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/11/14/sony_ericsson_noddy_phones/">Sony Ericsson's noddy phones</a>: "<i>Sony Ericsson's big idea, for two of the phones, the J220 and J230, is to include an option that allows the user to customise the interface to make it even simpler to use. They can either opt for the traditional multi icon interface or go for a single icon menu. This enables them to access their core features - and on these phones there aren't a great deal to chose from anyhow &#8211; with one click.</i>"</p>

<p>Weird.</p>

<p>Firstly, what's in it for a handset manufacturer with a brand of its own to make low-spec devices? Sure, they'll sell more but the margins must be lower on low-end kit using commoditised tech. I can understand why Vodafone want to sell a simple handset - it takes them to a customer-base they might not otherwise reach, which they can then tease into making more use of mobile - but not why SE want to make one.</p>

<p>Secondly - isn't this single-icon/multi-icon menu exactly what Series 40 has been doing for the last few years? I've not seen it, so I can't be sure, but it sounds identical.</p>

<p>Thirdly, it's a mark of how far we've come that a "simple" phone with core features only includes a 128x128 colour screen, calendar, games, and a radio :)</p>

<p>Anyone seen or heard any sales figures for Vodafone Simply btw?</p>
