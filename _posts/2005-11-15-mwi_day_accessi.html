<p><b>Accessing the web on the move</b></p>

<p>Used to work for AOL in 1995, starting in a portacabin working on internet radio etc.<br />
Doesn't think things have moved on very far since then.</p>

<p>Mobile: the fourth scren.<br />
There are more mobile phones in the UK than people.<br />
GPRS capable handsets exceeds 50% of those out there.</p>

<p>It's not just about technical difficulties. How can we work out what users want? Best practices aren't enough.<br />
