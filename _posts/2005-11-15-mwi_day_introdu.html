<p><b>Introduction from Tim Berners-Lee</b> (by video)</p>

<p>Our challenge is to create a web which is still "one web". It's important that we have one information space: if I give you a URI for something, it'll be the same thing for you that it is for me.</p>

<p>It's not about The Mobile Web as a separate entity, it's about making the web mobile.</p>

<p>We need to separate information from device type, by doing this now we insure ourselves against future devices.</p>
