<p><b>Making the web Truly Mobile, Jonas Wilhelmsson of Drutt </b></p>

<p>There are no killer applications; instead you need a large number of services<br />
cf Amazon and books. Long tail again (he calls it "the fat tail")</p>

<p>Currently:<br />
- Mobile operators drive the business<br />
- Walled gardens business model: 10-30% of subscribers use operator portals, high margins<br />
- Mission-critical functions: adaptation, integration and charging of content<br />
- Everything else is negotiable</p>

<p>The long tail will encourage the 75% of folks not currently using mobile data to do so</p>

<p>How to exploit potential:<br />
- Make the web truly mobile<br />
- Focus on where mobility adds value: do segmentation and transactions will follow</p>
