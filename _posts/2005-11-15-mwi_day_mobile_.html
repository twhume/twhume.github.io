<p><b>Mobile Web Potential and Challenges, Rhys Lewis of Volantis</b></p>

<p>Pre-processing of web (as opposed to browser-style post-processing)</p>

<p>Potential:<br />
- more users<br />
- more geographies<br />
- mobile use of existing applications<br />
- innovative new applications</p>

<p>Not everyone is using the great networks that we have here.</p>

<p>Discovery: <br />
- finding sites that work<br />
- finding sites that are interesting</p>

<p>Trust:<br />
- secure access<br />
- secure applications<br />
- trusted for payment</p>

<p>Technical challenges:<br />
- accelerating diversity<br />
- the way people think about the web embodies some assumptions which mobile challenges<br />
- even the 1:1 relationship between what an author writes and a user sees</p>
