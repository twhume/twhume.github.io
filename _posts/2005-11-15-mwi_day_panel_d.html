<p><b>Panel discussion</b></p>

<p>Rhys: standards for devices are hampered by need for differentiation. Lowest-common-denominator is not an acceptable approach<br />
Rotan: most authors of content online provide content but not metadata (purpose of page: info/navigation? relative importance of content). The accessibility world has standards for much of this metadata. Have we learned anything from the accessibility world?<br />
Rhys: a lot of the work in content adaptation is reverse-engineering the semantics of the original data. Other techniques include semantic enrichment (labelling bits of content), or abstractions.<br />
Franklin: people are lazy. Most web pages are "tag soup" with nothing to do with standards. I don't see this situation improving overnight.<br />
