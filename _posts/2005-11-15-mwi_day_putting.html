<p><b>Putting the vision into practice</b></p>

<p>Representing .mobi, who are here to answer the question: "why bother"?</p>

<p>Who we are:<br />
- want to improve the consumer experience of using the internet on mobile devices<br />
- not so much about tech challenges as about trust challenges<br />
- a sponsored top level domain<br />
- mid-2006 launch</p>

<p>Guiding principles<br />
- solve real consumer problems<br />
- guarantee a minimum predictable experience<br />
- Have Rules - some of which are enforceable and auditable<br />
- supported by a developer community: specs, tools, techniques, use cases, etc.</p>

<p>Approach:<br />
- style guide for web browsing<br />
- others (e.g. email on mobile) later</p>

<p>.mobi is a brand designed to imbue consumers with confidence</p>
