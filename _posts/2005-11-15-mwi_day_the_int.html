<p><b>The Integrated Operator's Perspective on Mobile Web, Keith Waters of France Telecom</b></p>

<p>FT does mobile, web and internet, and recognises the value of cross-platform delivery.<br />
One web is an ultimate goal, not a solved problem<br />
Profileration of devices: author once, publish many<br />
Increased mobility: right content in the right place at the right time</p>

<p>Mobile web of tomorrow != desktop PC of today</p>

<p>Two examples of consistent user experiences:<br />
- web mini-applications (e.g. desktop widgets)<br />
- consistent user experience from desktop to mobile<br />
- apple widgets can be used on mobile</p>

<p>- browser based application to display LBS info and signal strength</p>
