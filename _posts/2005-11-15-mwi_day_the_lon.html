<p><b>The Long Tail, Franklin Davis of Nokia</b></p>

<p>We recognise that most of the long tail of content won't bother adapting their content.<br />
HDML -> WAP 1.0 -> WAP hype -> WAP crash -> I-Mode success -> I-mode non-replication -> WAP 2.0 -> Walled gardens<br />
(but this isn't actually accurate; WAP 1.0 and I-mode launched near-simultaneously, not consecutively)</p>

<p>If I have 5, 10, 15% of my traffic coming from mobile devices, then I will have users complaining that my site doesn't work, and it's then in *my* interest to fix my site. There's no motivation for content providers to do this until they have traffic.</p>

<p>Mobile browsing vision: "By 2015 most people will have access to most of human knowledge wherever they are all the time"</p>

<p>Key browsing use cases:<br />
- LBS<br />
- Subscriptions<br />
- Infotainment (top one, filling odd moments of time or meeting spontaneous information needs)<br />
- Content discovery.download (portals)<br />
- Personal publishing<br />
- Image galleries (how does this differ from PP)</p>

<p>Mobile browsers are stuck "before the chasm" - it's an early aadopter thing</p>

<p>New S60 web browser based on same core as Safari: KDE Konqueror<br />
Based on zooming in and out of web pages<br />
"People understand web pages"<br />
Making it possible to use the full web. The idea being that once these sites are getting mobile visitors they'll start following W3C recommendations.<br />
Has an RSS reader; right now doesn't do updating of feeds (future versions will do this)</p>

<p><i>I'm not massively impressed by the browser; if it's any good then why will anyone want to have content adapted for it. If it's bad, then why will anyone use it to browse sites in the first place? Seems to rely on a groundswell of users who are prepared to use it to have a poor experience.</i></p>
