<p><b>Vision and ambition for the mobile web, Philipp Hoschka</b></p>

<p>WAP 1.0 was the result of the first W3C event: not massively successful (he says).<br />
Today mobile services focus on messaging, ringtones, music, TV... not web access.<br />
What's changed:<br />
- diversity of handsets<br />
- large installed base: 1.1b web-capable handsets worldwide: 63% of all handsets<br />
- installed base growing!<br />
- but disappointing usage: 50% of web-capable phones not set up to use web; 24% only used once for web access<br />
Positive signs:<br />
- Browsing is #1 data packet generating service, especially for 3G users (source: Nokia study, 2005)<br />
Another change: web has become a mass medium.<br />
Want to make mobile web as easy as desktop<br />
MWI approach:<br />
- Solve interop and usability issues for content providers and end users<br />
- developer program: explaining how to use existing tech and improving implementations, not introducing new tech<br />
Many sponsors</p>

<p><b>Mobile Web Best Practices Working Group</b><br />
Audience: content providers/web developers<br />
Making web content work on mobile: guidelines and pitfalls<br />
Chair: Dan Applequist<br />
Best practices: first draft<br />
Studies tips and tricks (from W3C accessibility, iMode, Opera, Openwave, Nokia etc.)<br />
Distilled these into a single document<br />
Is a work in progress: feedback is sought!<br />
- Best practices say you should identify the cost of following a link.</p>

<p><b>Device Description working group</b><br />
Needed for content adaptation<br />
Mission: how to improve quality and sharing of device info<br />
Ongoing work:<br />
- survey of existing technologies<br />
- understand who does what and why<br />
Potential future work: shared, open device description database<br />
Sounds like they're planning to reinvent the wheel WURFL-wise</p>

<p><b>Future work for MWI<br />
</b>MobileOK validator<br />
Device description database<br />
Test suites<br />
Training<br />
... all still under discussion</p>

<p>Mobile web feels like web 1995: Philipp draws analogies:<br />
- too slow<br />
- lack of interop<br />
- child protection<br />
- not accessible (handicapped etc)</p>

<p>But there are differences:<br />
- mobile web has more users than web95<br />
- lots of potential mobile content<br />
- there is an industry around the mobile web, supporting it</p>

<p>"When will we party like it's 1999?"</p>
