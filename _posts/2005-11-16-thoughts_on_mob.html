<p>A bit o'travel has left me with some time to run through the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-mobile-bp-20051017/">mobile web best practices document</a>. Some thoughts typed up:</p>

<p>1. The document states that its "<i>primary goal is to improve the user experience of the Web when accessed from mobile devices.</i>". Does this imply that there are many situations where the document doesn't seek to apply? e.g. in any WAP/XHTML-MP services being produced (which are mobile-specific, not web sites)? Or am I reading the document too pedantically? To me, the web on mobile seems to be distinct from mobile apps which might share elements of infrastructure or technology.</p>

<p>2. Given the comparative rarity of devices which can browse "the mobile web" today (we're talking PDAs and a few high-end handsets aren't we?) then am I right in thinking that this document is focused more on a hypothetical future of 2-3 years away than around services being built today/tomorrow?</p>

<p>3. I'd agree with most of the recommendations. They seem in some parts to be head-thumpingly simple and obvious, but I've been very close to this industry for some time now so that's to be expected, I think (and IMHO one characteristic of a good idea is that it's obvious in retrospect). I don't believe these are necessarily obvious to a target audience of web developers.</p>

<p>4. I'd be interested to hear more about the advantages of mobile devices (section 3.7). This might provide a more positive counterweight to a document which is otherwise on a fairly negative slant (in that it's otherwise focused on limitations, things we cut out of the web to make mobile, etc.)</p>

<p>5. I'd agree with the assertion in section 4.2 that adaptation is required to deliver all non-trivial mobile services. We even saw this on the fixed internet (netscape vs ie) - sure, we got the users to make a decision as to which version they see (mmm that's a nice user experience) but it still happened.</p>

<p>Overall, this seems like a reasonable starting point to me. I don't see anything here that I violently disagree with; much of it seems vague but I suspect (not that I've ever been involved in an effort like this) that with many vendors pulling in different directions, any consensus is a success.</p>

<p>One weirdie tho: why is the semantic markup section there, when even the group admits it doesn't know what it is? Is TBL standing over them with a Big Stick?<br />
