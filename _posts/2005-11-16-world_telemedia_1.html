<p>Yay. Bumped into <a href="http://trendpatrol.typepad.com/">Nick</a> already.</p>

<p>Walked in on Conference Room 1 at the end of what I think were the keynotes...</p>

<p>Panelist talking about user-rated content. "<i>Like all good ideas it reminds me of something I saw 15 years ago</i>".</p>

<p>Guy from NZ: Revenue share is a distraction. Down under there's been a recognition of associated value - customer acquisition and retention etc. So content providers were moving away from revenue share to consultancy fees. Vodafone NZ slashed revenue shares.<br />
