<p>Very poorly attended talk, this. Maybe everyone is nursing a sore head after last night but there are only about 20 folks here.</p>

<p>Mobile phones as devices for consuming music</p>

<p><b>Neil Marshall, Sales Director DX3</b></p>

<p>The over-the-air experience is stopping the spread of mobiles as a channel for downloading music.</p>

<p>DX3 do full-track downloads for folks like Woolworths.</p>

<p>35% of people asked say they want a mobile phone to play, store and retrieve music (<i>tho asking people want they want when it comes to these new services may not be the best way of finding out</i>)</p>

<p><b>Jeremy Copp, Chief Sales Officer Beatnik</b></p>

<p>Beatnik provide audio software for handsets. So what does software like this enable, beyond full track downloads?</p>

<p>Mobile music is following the PC/Internet model: mobile music is synonymous with music downloads. What about other services, considering the capabilities and context of use which are different for mobile?</p>

<p>Mobiles are inherently audio devices; personalised to a great degree; connected constantly; and communication about music is a social norm (<i>is it? always? sounds wishy washy to me</i>).</p>

<p>Ringtone market is a great indicator of the potential of audio services - <i>is it?</i> It's well understood, available to all.</p>

<p>There's apparently an inverse relationship between spend on handset and spend on ringtones - folks with cheaper phones buy more.</p>

<p>We need over the air downloads to reach the mass market - can't assume the PC and fixed internet is available to all. <i>+1</i></p>

<p>User experience must be good: must be simple to find, preview and purchase content. They shouldn't require any technical knowledge of phone type, formats, etc. </p>

<p>Common audio formats are good (<i>slight yawn</i>)</p>

<p>Now he's talking about Mobile XMF, which I presume is a new format that Beatnik are pushing. Doesn't seem to be an open specification - looks like I have to pay for it.</p>

<p>Audio advertising - apparently this is good because customers are used to it from commercial radio.<br />
