<p><b>World Telemedia Day 2: Devices, Mike Grenville</b></p>

<p>Nokia pulled out of show.</p>

<p>What are phones actually used for? As watch replacement, address book, alarm clock, diary, torch (!), photo album, status symbol. Buying content isn't one of these things.</p>

<p>When T-Mobile launched MMS, they told handset manufacturers that if they put a cable in the phone box, the handset wouldn't sell - to drive OTA traffic.</p>

<p>Handset configuration is a problem; imagine if every time you bought a new network card, you had to phone up your ISP and get it configured!<br />
