<p><b>World Telemedia Day 2: Making it work across devices, Hila Dahan of Adamind</b></p>

<p>P2P and A2P multimedia services are growing. (What's A2P?)</p>

<p>Many devices. Many content types. Many data formats. </p>

<p>Transcoding as an alternative to manually versioning.</p>

<p>Converged services will be realised through transcoding. This all sounds quite naive to me, but oh look, Adamind are a transcoding company! They're building their own database of device attributes, optimisation rules, etc.</p>
