<p><b>World Telemedia Day 2: High Resolution 3D and the future of mobile content, Phil Atkin, nVidia</b></p>

<p>"A short history of NVIDIA... through real-time hair"</p>

<p>A history of PC games. Turning point was GLQuake with rendered lighting behaviours. </p>

<p>So what happened? Low-cost 3D accelerators. OpenGL, the first cross-platform standard. High-performance CPUs became available.</p>

<p>Games need: powerful CPUs. Standardised 3D APIs. Affordable 3D acceleration. I'd disagree with all these for mobile.</p>

<p>Java is not the best solution for gaming; it's interpreted, unresponsive, etc. JSRs help out here (JSR-184). BREW is good. Still no GLQuake yet.</p>

<p>Demo of Quake on a handset.</p>

<p>3D titles scale better to different resolutions so are more portable (sounds tenuous to me but hey I'm not a game developer).</p>

<p>"Phones are more like arcade machines than consoles": short play sessions.</p>

<p><i>Why 3D necessarily - just cos that's what console games did?</i></p>
