<p>My World Telemedia skit seemed to go OK. It wasn't as well-attended as I'd expected; with a name like "World Telemedia" I expected vast halls containing thousands of chattering mobile enthusiasts, not the die-hard 15 or so we got. But hey, that meant we could just chat to them a little more than would be otherwise possible, and quite a few of them hung around after for that.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ren-reynolds.com/">Ren Reynolds</a> and <a href="http://www.redherring.com/Article.aspx?a=13498&hed=20+Under+35:+Vicky+Wu">Vicky Wu<a/> of <a href="http://www.froghop.net/">FrogHop</a> ably coped with a missing speaker and ran the session. I still think a "transmedial access solution" sounds like something you hear shouted in an episode of ER, but I think I get what Vicky means now :) If you're into this stuff, take a look at <a href="http://frogblog.typepad.com/">the FrogBlog</a>.</p>

<p>The slides from my talk, "Building a mass market casual gaming service", a case study for our work with Puzzler over the last 18 months, are <a href="http://tomhume.typepad.com/wt-2005.pdf">here</a>. Of course all the really interesting stuff is in my notes and my head, neither of which are fit to be put online - drop me an email if you'd like to know more.<br />
