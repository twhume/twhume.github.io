<p><b>World Telemedia Day 3: Virtual Babies: Eccky, by Yme Bosma, Media Republic</b></p>

<p>*Bizarre* instant-messaging avatar generating thing where you invite your friends to create a baby with you, via IM.</p>

<p>Parents compete for attention from this baby. Parents just chat via IM with their baby, which apparently learns to talk gradually. Eccky will text parents to drag them back in.</p>

<p>1 day real time = 1 year game time, initially. Then they sped the game up to 1 day real time = 3 years game time.</p>

<p>Why? Eccky is about playing with someone else. Young people are living their lives online, and not alone. Eccky is an alpha version of a game which evolves around artificial life (oh god). </p>

<p>Behaves like any other user in the buddy list.</p>
