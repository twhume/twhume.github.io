<p><a href="http://www.imodestrategy.com/2005/11/_051120_weekly_.html#51120-2">DoCoMo launch another payment method</a>: "<i>iD will enhance existing credit card services by giving credit card owners the option of making payments via a DoCoMo wallet phone linked to the card, in addition to conventional payments with their plastic credit card. The payment procedure will be as simple as waving the phones in front of dedicated reader/writers at stores. No signature will be required for purchases under a certain amount, while purchases exceeding this amount will require the user to simply enter a password via a device linked to the reader/writer.</i>"</p>

<p>Either DoCoMo are very good at giving the impression that they're constantly rolling out amazing new services like this... or they're really doing it. I can understand their behind ahead of us when it comes to technology, but the rate at which they launch stuff is just phenomenal.</p>

<p>Why is this not the case in Europe? Discuss.</p>
