<p>In case you're a talented developer in or looking to move to, the Brighton area: <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">Future Platforms</a> are recruiting.</p>

<p>Ideally we're after someone with 3 or more years commercial experience of Java and OO software development; web application experience with Tomcat would be helpful too. We also want this person to be experienced with SQL and database, in particular MySQL - going beyond basic SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE stuff to actually understanding what's going on under-the-hood.</p>

<p>Good communication skills will be essential; the position will involve dealing directly with clients (everyone here does this to some degree). Oh - and a genuine enthusiasm for all things mobile is vital.</p>

<p><a href="mailto:recruitment@futureplatforms.com">Drop us an email</a> with a CV if you're interested. This is a full-time position. We will not be using any agencies to fill this role - if you're an agency, please don't bother contacting me about it.</p>
