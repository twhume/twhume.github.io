<p>It seems a bit redundant for me to comment on this <a href="http://mobhappy.typepad.com/russell_buckleys_mobhappy/2005/10/eplus_mvno_stra.html">month-old post from Carlo about MVNOs</a>: "<i>Mobile operators don't seem to like segmentation much, beyond perhaps positioning their prepaid and contract offerings at different age groups. But it's a viable strategy, and one they don't necessarily have to leave to outside MV</i>"</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2005/11/world_telemedia.html">John Strand talk</a> I went to last Wednesday has definitely made an impression on me: the idea that <a href="http://www.wirelessweek.com/article/CA608011.html?spacedesc=Features">no-frills MVNOs</a> are spreading across Europe and eating into the territories of incumbent operators is exhilirating: simultaneously scary (a shake-up like that could change the landscape of our industry more than a little) and exciting: disruption always throws up a load of new opportunities.</p>
