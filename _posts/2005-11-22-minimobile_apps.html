<p>Now this is a good example of what I'd like to see for mobile: mini-apps, like <a href="http://www.tadalist.com/">TadaList</a> or <a href="http://www.meetwithapproval.com/">MeetWithApproval</a>, that do a single thing nice and cleanly.</p>

<p>The big gap I see now is an app to help you synchronise with >2 people; getting consensus from 3 or more folks using SMS "by hand" is a nightmare, wouldn't it be nicer if you could just get everyone sent a single message which lets them comment, argue, and decide...</p>
