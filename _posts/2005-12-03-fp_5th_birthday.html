<div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/69395473/" title="photo sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/9/69395473_ffa7fa309d_m.jpg" alt="" style="border: solid 2px #000000;" /></a> <br /> <span style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 0px;"> </span></div>I'm not sure if I posted about it at the time - because err all the posts from that time got lost in a <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2005/10/intermission.html">server accident</a> - but <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">Future Platforms</a> turned 5 in September.

<p>We were horribly busy at the time (obviously) so didn't celebrate it at the time - and remedied this on Thursday of this week, by closing the office and relocating to Brussels for the day.</p>

<p>In summary: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/twhume/69389780/in/set-1494794/">Eurostar</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/twhume/69390018/in/set-1494794/">pissing</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/twhume/69391269/in/set-1494794/">statues</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/twhume/69391759/in/set-1494794/">EU parliament</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/twhume/69390901/in/set-1494794/">Tin Tin</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/twhume/69391129/in/set-1494794/">cheese</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/twhume/69392660/in/set-1494794/">beer</a>, gadgets, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/twhume/69393345/in/set-1494794/">idiocy</a>. Full photo set is <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/twhume/sets/1494794/">here</a> - I'm sure there will be others. And, as will now be traditional, absent friends get to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/twhume/69397065/">chew on a chocolate pope</a>.</p>

<p>On a more sentimental note: wow, 5 years. This means I've been working longer here than anywhere else I've ever been: and despite that, it's still fun. So a big thankyou to everyone who's been a part of that, and those who continue to be.</p>
