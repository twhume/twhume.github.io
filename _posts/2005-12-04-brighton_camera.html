<p>Whilst I'm on the subject of dScape, it'd be worth popping over for a look at the <a href="http://www.wiredsussex.com/dscape/index.html">results of the cameraphone competition</a> we ran for Wired Sussex: inviting folks from across Brighton to send in their snaps of the city, which were projected onto a backdrop at the evening event (and look rather smart, if I say so myself). All credit to Jon Andrews and Devi Lozdan @ FP for their work on this.</p>
