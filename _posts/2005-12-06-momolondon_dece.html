It was interesting to hear about how the JCP process actually built fragmentation in; what a crazy thing for a standards process to do!

<p>My slides from the night are <a href="http://tomhume.typepad.com/MoMo.pdf">here</a>. They probably don't make much sense without me jabbering for 10 minutes around them.</p>

<p>Thanks to Fjord/Flirtomatic for hosting the evening and Stuart John for his MCing sk1llz...</p>
