<p><a href="http://www.appelsiini.net/keitai-l/archives/2005-12/0053.html">Interesting point</a> I'd not considered from Christopher Kobayashi, on the Keitai-L list: "<i>Kind of spooky to think that there's web connections in the background<br />
without the user pressing a link/button. Basically meaning that<br />
they'll be charged without them knowing it.<br />
If you're on a unlimited data plan this wouldn't matter much, but what<br />
about the poor souls not on this plan. Bad people can make things<br />
expensive, or is there a limit to this...</i>"</p>
