<p><a href="http://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,16376,1660765,00.html">ICUE launches</a>: "<i>Starting up was surprisingly easy. You simply send a text message to 64888 with the word ICUE typed into the text section. You soon receive another text message inviting you to click on a web address. After three or four clicks you are on its website and free to choose from a number of books. I chose the free one, Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, and opted to store it on a memory card rather than on the phone itself. It is claimed to work on most cameraphones.</i>"</p>

<p><a href="http://www.i-cue.co.uk/">ICUE</a> is another one of the things that's been keeping us busy over the last few months: a huge stack of novels (over 250 at the last count) distributed as MIDlets for 42 handsets (so far), with a WAP store presenting them for sale. Visuals by Blair Kimber, implemented by a crack team of <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">FPers</a>: Ms Lozdan, Mr Andrews, Mr Hopper, Mr Leies and Mr Skinner.</p>
