<p>Helen Keegan has one of the <a href="http://technokitten.blogspot.com/2005/12/what-is-mobile-marketing_08.html">most comprehensive descriptions</a> of mobile marketing that I've ever seen:</p>

<p>"<i>Whenever I meet someone new and I tell them what I do for a living, they usually assume one or both of the following:</p>

<p>1. That mobile marketing is sending junk text messages to get people to subscribe, unwittingly, to a mobile content subscription service. Ergo, mobile marketing is bad.</p>

<p>2. Mobile marketing = marketing using SMS (text messaging)</p>

<p>Neither assumption is true so this is my lowdown on what mobile marketing includes.</i>"</p>
