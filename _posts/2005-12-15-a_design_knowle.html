problems, but it&rsquo;s a hard habit to quit: it makes everything seem like it&rsquo;s going <br />
great and the project is meeting its milestones, when in in fact it&rsquo;s going badly <br />
in all ways other than the Gantt chart.  This is, however, a deeply rooted <br />
methodology and can&rsquo;t be changed instantly. </i>"</p>
