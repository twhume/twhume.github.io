<p><a href="http://www.smallsurfaces.com/2005/11/designing-for-illiterate-people/">Designing for illiterate people</a> is an interesting one. It's something we've been looking at out of the corner of our eyes, sidelong-ly rather than a full on stare. I draw your attention this paragraph, about I-Cue founder Marc Lewis: "<i>Marc retains a 75 per cent interest in ICUE but intends to channel all his profits into a new trust to help children and adults improve their reading skills.</i>"</p>
