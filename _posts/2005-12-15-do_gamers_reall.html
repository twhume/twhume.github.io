<p><a href="http://www.joystiq.com/entry/1234000110072511/">Do gamers really want photorealistic graphics?</a>: "<i>The problem of increasing programming and artist time is one that a vast section of the industry is going to have to address. As budgets and graphical expectations (from the greedy gaming public) rise out of control, publishers and developers are going to have to make a choice: graphics or gameplay.</i>"</p>

<p>The assumption that photorealism means a better game, or that 3D means a better game: deeply flawed, I reckon.</p>
