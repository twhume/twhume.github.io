<p><a href="http://www.smallsurfaces.com/2005/11/usability-testing-of-mobile-applications/">Usability testing of mobile applications</a>: "<i>Usability testing a mobile application in the laboratory seems to be sufficient when studying user interface and navigation issues. The usability of a consumer application was tested in two environments: in a laboratory and in a field with a total of 40 test users. The same problems were found in both environments, differences occurred in the frequency of findings between the contexts. Results indicate that conducting a time-consuming field test may not be worthwhile when searching user interface flaws to improve user interaction.</i>"<br />
