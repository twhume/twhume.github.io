That's not to say it isn't an incredible product. It's just hard to defend the cool factor when the President apparently has two of them...</i>"</p>

<p>Actually, I'd argue that it's when things stop being cool that they start getting interesting. For me, this was the case with mobile phones: when they were something special that yuppies lugged around with them in the 80s: boring. When everyone you knew had one: interesting.</p>

<p>Ditto microprocessors, puzzles, and the internet.</p>
