<p>Stuff that's been lurking in NetNewsWire for at least a month now. I'd hope to tease these into individual posts but despite having a fab Christmas break didn't get a chance:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.janchipchase.com/blog/archives/2005/11/mobile_essentia.html">Why do people carry mobile phones?</a>
<li> <a href="http://www.keepthebelton.co.uk/conk/index.htm">Bluetooth conkers</a> - excellent idea!
<li> <a href="http://www.mobilecommunitydesign.com/archives/000149.php">Mobile phones and public displays</a>; I suspect that the same sort of dynamics will be in play when using mobile to interact with TV content: a single screen shared between multiple viewers, etc. Is mobile+TV a better iTV than iTV?
<li> Apparently <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=28375">handset updates are the future</a>... I'm sceptical of this, given that the industry hasn't yet coped with device diversity as it affects the provision of services (leaving space for projects like the <a href="http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/">WURFL</a> to step in). Updating the firmware of devices from many manufacturers over different networks etc? I know the iTV guys do it on occasion but I'll bet it's not as painless as this article (cough press release) suggests...
<li> Amp'd are <a href="http://www.mobilewhack.com/reviews/ampd_mobiles_mobile_entertainment.html">producing and licensing their own content</a>. I like the sound of Amp'd and the idea of MVNOs targeting specific markets but now that I've drunk the I-mode Kool-Aid I'm wondering how workable this is long-term. In how many mature mobile markets are operators taking this approach?
<li> <a href="http://www.mobileatm.co.uk/About_MobileATM.htm">MobileATM promises</a> access to basic but useful banking services from your phone. <A href="http://www.mobileatm.co.uk/Press_Releases.htm">Apparently</a> this was due to be available by the end of 2005 but I've not seen any sign of it...
</ul>
