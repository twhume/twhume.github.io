<p>Oops. It's "disagree with Ajit" week here at tomhume.org. When he <a href="http://www.ecademy.com/module.php?mod=club&op=forum&c=24&t=388186#388451">posts</a> that "<i>Not a lot of people are actually browsing the mobile internet. Although WAP usage shows phenomenal growth, these figures include the use of WAP as a transport mechanism - typically for downloading content. In other words, every time you download a ringtone, you implicitly create a WAP page impression. I suspect the real figures used by consumers to actually browse the mobile internet are very low.</i>"</p>

<p>I'd like to see some evidence that figures for browsing the mobile internet are low. With the MDA <a href="http://www.text.it/wap/default.asp?intPageId=837">noting an average daily total of 58.9m WAP page impressions in the UK</a> then either everyone in the UK is downloading a ringtone every day, or something else is artifically inflating these figures.</p>

<p>(Nothing personal Ajit ;))</p>
