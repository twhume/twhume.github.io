<p>Helen has a good post on <a href="http://technokitten.blogspot.com/2006/01/participation-tv-as-part-of-mobile.html">participation TV as part of the mobile marketing mix</a>: "<i>And at last, this year, we&rsquo;re beginning to see more interesting ways of interacting with consumers via mobile leveraging the popularity of key TV shows. </i>"</p>

<p>Oh yes. I'm keeping fingers crossed that I'll be able to talk about something we're doing in this area soon. In many ways mobile makes a better tool for interacting with TV than the "red button":</p>

<ul>
<li> It's personal, not social - so many individuals can interact at the same time (and hey, for many TV is a social activity);
<li> There's a billing mechanism built in (as there is in some, but not all, iTV infrastructures);
<li> It's independent of the whole TV value chain; you don't need to butter up Sky, NTL, etc. to add an interactive element to your TV property if you do it via mobile;
<li> It lets viewers engage with a programme even when they're not in front of the TV;
<li> It lets players interact in many ways; sending text triggers, via "remote control" Java MIDlets, sending in photos, video... you name it;
</ul>

<p>Of course there are problems in enabling this kind of interactivity (how do you scale up web services to handle a massive volume of simultaneous users in a restricted timeframe?) but they aren't insurmountable.</p>

<p>But I *would* say all that, wouldn't I... ;)<br />
