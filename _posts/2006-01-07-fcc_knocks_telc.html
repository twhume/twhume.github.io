<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/01/07/ces_fcc_wsj/">FCC knocks telcos' secret plan to divide and bill the web</a>: "<i>The story reveals that large phone companies have been threatening to charge the likes of Google and Vonage for "high-quality delivery of music, movies and the like over their telecommunications networks."</i>"</p>

<p>Interesting. Are the economics of running a wireless network different enough from those of running a wired network to permit this sort of thing? And does this indicate a telecomms industry move towards, not away, from walled gardens?</p>

<p>Ignoring what might be best for Internet incumbents... what's best for customers here? This reminds me of John Strands thoughts at World Telemedia, that in order to present content to customers at a single, easily-understood price points (as opposed to separate transaction plus obscure traffic charges), content providers should be bulk-buying bandwidth at discounted rates and taking on the delivery charges - just as they do for SMS today.</p>
