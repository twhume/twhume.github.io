<p>Yep. I've heard (through t'grapevine - no NDAs broken on this blog!) that Google are interested in combining AdSense and mobile. Hey - it makes sense: classifieds and mobile are a good fit, just like puzzles and mobile: small chunks of targeted content, familiar in nature, time-sensitive, and high-value (to the right person at the right time). </p>
