<p><a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2006/01/jealousy.html">A VC: Jealousy</a>: "<i>Fat chance guys.&#160; The consumer is already paying for the Internet connection.&#160; They aren't going to stand for another monthly payment to the service provider because the service provider has to pay the Telco too.&#160; Double dipping doesn't work as a business model generally speaking and certainly not in a commodity business where there are less barriers to entry every day.</i>"</p>

<p>Who says the customer has to pay? Why can't a service provider, making money out of the customers they service, pay for this and roll it into their costs?</p>
