<p><a href="http://mobhappy.com/blog1/2006/01/18/apple-signals-iphone/">Apple Signals iPhone at MobHappy</a>: "<i>Secondly, the sector for stand alone MP3 players will implode shortly - next year at the latest, but I would say that it may well have peaked already. Outside of a few die-hards, we&rsquo;ll be listening to our mobiles as our main source for a music player</i>"</p>

<p>I wonder. How many people do *you* know who regularly listen to their music on their mobile phone?</p>

<p>I don't think I know a single one. MP3 players are cheap enough that you can buy one if you want music on-the-go - they don't force you to use bizarre syncing software (well, most don't) in the way that phones do, and you don't lose the ability to call your friends (or be contacted) if you use them a lot.</p>

<p>I'm sceptical about convergence here.</p>
