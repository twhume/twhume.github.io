<p><a href="http://mobilegirl.blogspot.com/2005/03/gdc-mobile-its-all-about-casual-game_09.html">It's all about the Casual Game</a>: "<i>It seems as though many people are just beginning to really understand this concept. They are talking about how the market for mobile games is NOT the same as the gamer market. They are trying to figure out how to create short burst, interesting games which users can play in their free time. However, many of the people in this space are coming at it from a gamers perspective. They are talking about high-end 3D rendering engines, haptic responses, and tactile reflexes. They are using the camera for coordinates or putting real images on character bodies, just because they can. They are thinking about how to create video games. Only mobile video games requiring short interaction times.</i>"</p>

<p>Yep. Well - casual games have become a bandwagon over the last year, haven't they? With the result that everyone from XBox 360 down is trying to present themselves as "casual"...</p>
