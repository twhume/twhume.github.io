<p><a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=29113">ShoZu does what MMS promised</a>: "<i>Bole reckons ShoZu's popularity has grown sufficiently to encourage both handset vendors and network operators to licence the client. It remains free to the public.</i>"</p>

<p>Damn right. It's an interesting app too - independent of operator, content provider or handset vendor, oiling the wheels between customers and useful services. I wonder what other similar things are out there, on the cusp of being released? Simple audioblogging software? Something to tie in cell ID LBS? Something to log all your sent and received text messages onto the network and archive them in perpetuity? </p>
