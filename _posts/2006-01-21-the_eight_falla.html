<p>Just found this via <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jag">James Gosling</a>:</p>

<blockquote><i>"Essentially everyone, when they first build a distributed application, makes the following eight assumptions. All prove to be false in the long run and all cause big trouble and painful learning experiences.

<ol>
<li>	The network is reliable
<li>	Latency is zero
<li>	Bandwidth is infinite
<li>	The network is secure
<li>	Topology doesn't change
<li>	There is one administrator
<li>	Transport cost is zero
<li>	The network is homogeneous"</i></ol></blockquote>
