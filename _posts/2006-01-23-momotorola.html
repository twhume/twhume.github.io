<p>More on the <a href="http://www.mobiface.com/view.php?id=11">new Motorola UI</a>. I know I shouldn't snipe on the basis of a couple of screenshots, but mmmmm a "Manage" menu: descriptive. And as the writer of this piece notes, cascading submenus, windows... all the kind of stuff you want to lose on a handset UI IMHO.</p>
