<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/01/26/bluetooth_bests_wifi/page2.html">Bluetooth set to take over wireless from Wi-Fi...</a>: "<i>Some time in the next two years, I expect to see metro area authorities start to call for the banning of Wi-Fi except for the networks they run themselves. They'll be happy to have residents use the metro Wi-Fi, but they won't be happy to have their own critical communications infrastructure sabotaged by seeing fifteen residents each set up a powerful MIMO device on channel 11.</i>"<br />
