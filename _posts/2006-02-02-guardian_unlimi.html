<p><a href="http://www.mobileindustry.biz/article.php?article_id=1073">Guardian Unlimited launches Sudoku puzzle league</a>: "<i>Guardian Unlimited and Solid State have announced the launch of a new Sudoku league which lets players solve puzzles on their mobile phones and submit scores to compete head-to-head in the online league.</i>"</p>

<p>Vague professional envy here :) Puzzler Sudoku has an online league but it's not as exposed as it should be (yet).</p>

<p>I've not tried the Guardian service myself, but it looks like they're doing some sensible stuff around leagues and pricing... Good to hear that it's "<i>mobile as part of our overall strategy, rather than a distinct mobile strategy.</i>"</p>
