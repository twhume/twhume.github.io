<p>So... I'm going to be attending and speaking at <a href="http://europe.casuality.org/">Casuality Europe</a> next week in Amsterdam; and a couple of us FP folk will be at <a href="http://www.3gsmworldcongress.com/">3GSM</a> from Tuesday to Thursday. From what I've heard half of the UK mobile industry are going to be on that first Easyjet flight on Tuesday morning ;)</p>

<p>If anyone reading this fancies taking the opportunity to meet face-to-face at either event, that'd be fantastic; leave a comment or drop  me an email (Tom dot Hume at futureplatforms dot com)...<br />
