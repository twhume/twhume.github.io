<p><a href="http://www.mobileindustry.biz/article.php?article_id=1057">Vodafone to launch fixed price download system</a>: "<i>Mobile operator Vodafone has announced the launch of a new pricing model for content which will allow content providers to charge a fixed price for downloads, including data charges, with the cost of the data transfer being included in the content price.</i>"</p>

<p>Yay - excellent move, I hope the others follow suit. This is exactly <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2005/11/world_telemedia.html">what John Strand proposed</a> at World Telemedia last year. Simplifying the nightmarish complexity of data tariffs can only be a good thing.</p>
