<p><a href="http://www.alatto.com/blog/2006/03/bluetooth-billboard-advertising.html">Bluetooth billboard advertising campaign</a>: "<i>According to an article in the Sunday Business Post last week, several billboards around Ireland have been fitted with bluetooth transceivers and if punters come within range they are prompted to download some Lynx related content.</i>"</p>

<p>Sergio and I spent several minutes standing in front of a supposedly-Bluetoothing screen in Victoria station the other week, being URGED to activate Bluetooth and experience the future of advertising.</p>

<p>I can therefore report that the future of advertising involves staring at a big screen, then back at your phone, for a few times. Then shaking your phone a bit, turning it on and off, and finally walking home a little disappointed.</p>
