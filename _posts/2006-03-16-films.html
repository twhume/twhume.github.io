<p>I've been to the cinema a couple of times over the last 2 days (ooh busy me), seeing <a href="http://www.mcdonaldrutter.com/Television/roadtoguantanamo/roadtoguantanamo.htm">The Road to Guantanemo</a> at the lovely lovely Duke of Yorks, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365737/">Syriana</a> last night at the Odeon w/Dan.</p>

<p>RtG was darkly comical, but hideous: three lads from Birmingham, completely out of their depth, terrified and bewildered. If the descriptions of their interrogations are true then their captors seem just as clueless.</p>

<p>Syriana I enjoyed, but it didn't live up to its "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181865/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9dHJhZmZpY3xmdD0xfG14PTIwfGxtPTUwMHxjbz0xfGh0bWw9MXxubT0x;fc=1;ft=104;fm=1">Traffic</a> of the oil industry" monicker. It seemed deliberately disjointed, dragging together its narrative threads towards the end but never really getting into enough depth around the various sub-plots to make me really care about the characters. Still, any film where you get to see George Clooney having his fingernails ripped out can't be all bad.</p>
