<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/03/27/hotxt_richard/">'Dragon' unveils flat-fee text service</a>: "<i>Targeted at 16-25 year olds, Hotxt offers punters the chance to send as many texts as they like for just &pound;1 a week. The catch is that this inclusive price is subject to network data charges and texts to people not on the Hotxt network cost more.</i>"</p>

<p>This is by no means the only one of these services out there now. The value-driven pricing of SMS compared to per-megabyte pricing of data clearly creates an opportunity for these services; the big question in my mind is how successfully can these kinds of businesses tug users away from SMS, under the noses of the operators?<br />
