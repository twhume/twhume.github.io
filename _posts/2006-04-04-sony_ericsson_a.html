<p><a href="http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2006/04/04/sony_ericsson_walkman_w700/">Sony Ericsson announces eighth Walkman phone</a>: "<i>Sony Ericsson today Liberac&eacute;d up its Walkman music phone line, adding a new W700 candybar model kitted out in a "titanium gold"-coloured casing</i>"</p>

<p>I've just crossed over to the dark side, swapping my Nokia N70 for a Sony Ericsson K750i - and I have to say I'm mightily impressed. The form factor is way superior, it's lighter, battery life is significantly better (though it's GPRS as opposed to 3G), and the real killer... it actually syncs with my Mac. The N70 had started dropping contacts, losing them, failing to sync calendars, and so on.</p>

<p>I was also pleasantly surprised to find some solid UI improvements over Nokia, particularly in choosing destinations for text messages, handling missed calls, and so on. So 3 days in I've no regrets; I suspect there'll be some native Symbian apps I miss one day, but not yet...</p>

<p>Update: battery life on this thing is very impressive. I've just had 4.5 days of usage out of it before needing a recharge...</p>
