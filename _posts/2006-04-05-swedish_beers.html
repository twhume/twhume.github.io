<p><img src="http://www.nordicbar.com/images/man.gif" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5">Yay, <a href="http://swedishbeers.blogspot.com/">Swedish Beers</a> reasserts itself my favourite mobile networking event... principally because it's a group of nice interesting folk getting hammered in a half-decent bar, and doesn't suffer too much from the press-release-reciting puffery that some other events tend towards.</p>

<p>Had a great time at Nordic Bar last night, mob-handed with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devi_lozdan/">Devi</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ribot/">Ribot</a> of FP (if you can call 3 a mob). It was great to catch up with a few folks I'd not seen for a while - <a href="http://technokitten.blogspot.com/">Helen</a>, <a href="http://www.mbites.co.uk/">Mike</a>, Nick, <a href="http://www.keitaiculture.com/">Steve</a> and <a href="http://www.mi-pay.com/">Simon</a> - and meet a few new faces (<a href="http://www.ionsquare.com/">Oleg</a> and the mighty <a href="http://www.masabi.com/">Masabists</a>).</p>

<p>Thanks to the obsessive photography of Mr Ribot, the evening is well documented. I'm assured that footage will follow.</p>

<p>And big wooo to Helen for organising it all!</p>
