<p><a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=30943">Mobile operators miss a World Cup opportunity</a>: "<i>The report suggests that normally only around 30 per cent of cameraphone snaps end up being sent as picture messages. </i>"</p>

<p>Wow - it's the same old story here, turn those stats around, remove the word "only" and they look quite positive. 30% of all photos being taken are sent as MMS messages? Personally I don't believe it - that seems astonishingly high to me and I'm sure the operators would be releasing actual figures if it were the case.</p>
