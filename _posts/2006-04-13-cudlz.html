<p>Cudlz has launched - I've been keeping an eye out for this for a while now, it always looked like it'd be quite interesting. And I think it is. What I like about this:</p>

<p>1. The ease with which you can sign up. I was on the site in a flash.</p>

<p>2. The freeform manner in which you describe yourself. Yeah I know tags are flavour-of-the-month and terribly fashionable, but I like it in this instance.</p>

<p>3. The way they tease money out of you. I spent &pound;1.50 without thinking about it; it's really rather special.</p>

<p>Of course, their user base seems to be me and about 6 others right now, and whether tagging etc works will need a large number of folks all self-describing to tell... but first impressions are good.</p>
