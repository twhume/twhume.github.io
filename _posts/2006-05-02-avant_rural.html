<p>I want to go to this: <a href="http://www.avantrural.com/">AvantRural</a>. Found a flyer for it in my pocket this morning as I walked into work - I think someone pressed it into my sweaty palm as I wandered down the North Laine on Saturday.</p>

<p>Dress code: "wellington boots and dressing gowns appreciated but not required". The flyer promises "bovine modulation" and "badgercore"... brought to you by (amongst others) "the early gurning centre".</p>

<p>But "badgercore".</p>

<p>Say it again.</p>

<p>"badgercore"</p>
