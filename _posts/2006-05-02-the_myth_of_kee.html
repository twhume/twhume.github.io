<p><a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/04/the_myth_of_kee.html">The myth of "keeping up"</a>: "<i>You can't keep up. There is no way. And trying to keep up will probably just make you dumber.You can never be current on everything you think you should be. You can't simultaneously be current on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Technology<li>Current events<li>Pop culture<li>Professional practices<li>Health/fitness/diet trends
</ul>

<p>And on and on and on...</i>"</p>

<p>I like some of their ways around this though:</p>

<ul><li>"<i>Unsubscribe to as many things as possible<li>Pick the categories you want for a balanced perspective, and include some from OUTSIDE your main field of interest</i>"</ul></i>
