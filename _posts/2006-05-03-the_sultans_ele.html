<p>I got handed a flier for <a href="http://www.thesultanselephant.com/">this</a> whilst in London today; it looks interesting:</p>

<p>"<i>The Sultan&rsquo;s Elephant is a spectacle you&rsquo;ve only imagined... Created by theatrical magicians Royal de Luxe, it tells the story of a sultan from far-off lands and his magical, time-travelling mechanical elephant. Forty feet high and 42 tonnes in weight, this beautiful creature will capture the hearts and minds of everyone who sees it.</p>

<p>The Sultan&rsquo;s Elephant is played out over four days in the streets, squares and public spaces of central London. Whether you dip into it for three hours or follow its progress for three days, this breathtaking show will live in your memory forever.</i>"</p>
