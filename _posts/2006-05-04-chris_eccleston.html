<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/05/04/prisoner_remake/">Chris Eccleston linked to remake of The Prisoner</a>: "<i>Former Doctor Who Christopher Eccleston has been "linked" with the lead role in a remake of The Prisoner, the BBC reports.</i>"</p>

<p>Oooh... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prisoner">The Prisoner</a> was a part of my weekly routine when I was at Lewes Tertiary College doing my A-level retakes. I spent every Thursday night attempting to make sense of occasionally impenetrable 60s weirdness... which from what I've read is what the cast spent most of their time doing in between filming the thing.</p>
