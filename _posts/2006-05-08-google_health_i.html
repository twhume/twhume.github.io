<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/05/08/google_health_is_coming/">Google Health</a>: "<i>...will offer targeted search for sickies. Predicted to launch later this week the search can be refined and results put into categories like "treatment, research papers, symptoms, news, alternative treatments". It also divides information up according to expected audience - stuff for health professionals rather than patients for example.</i>"</p>

<p>Sounds ripe for wireless. Healthcare information is intimately personal, has clear value to its (patient-)consumer, and is needed anywhere; we know this from our work with <a href="http://www.pocketdoctor.co.uk/">PocketDoctor</a> (Future Platforms first ever client). I'm sure it's only a matter of time before we see Google Health Mobile...</p>
