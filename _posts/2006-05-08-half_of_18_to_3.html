<p><a href="http://technokitten.blogspot.com/2006/05/half-of-18-to-34s-are-embracing-mobile.html">Musings of a mobile marketer</a>: "<i>57% of 18 to 34 year olds have interacted with a company via a short code </i>"</p>

<p>I'm sitting on the train tapping this out and can't see the original study which Helen quotes, so I'm a bit sceptical about any claim that anyone "embraces mobile advertising".</p>

<p>But this stat, if true, means 34.2m people in the UK have interacted with a shortcode. I don't know how this compares to other mechanisms for response - post, telephone calls, web site visits - or how well these other mechanisms can be tracked. Does anyone have figures for them? I'd like to see at what point mobile has, or will, become *the* primary means for ad response.</p>

<p>Insert my standard rant about the ad industry shying away from this stuff because it actively fears accountability here...</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Jack@FP has pointed out that my maths is completely off here... it's 57% of 18-34 year olds, not 57% of the UK population as a whole. Duh. Thanks Jack!</p>
