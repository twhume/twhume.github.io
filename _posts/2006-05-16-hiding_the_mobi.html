<p><a href="http://mobhappy.com/blog1/2006/05/10/hiding-the-mobile-internet/">Hiding The Mobile Internet at MobHappy</a>: "<i>Second, operators should focus on adding value to users&rsquo; internet experiences by recognizing that mobile browsing is different than browsing from a computer and add to (not replace) the open access with more customized services and sites for users that want them. It should be an additive strategy that takes full browsing capability as a starting point, then builds on top of it, not a plan that throws the Internet that people know and love out the window, then opens up tiny holes to let only particular content through.</i>"</p>

<p>Sounds very sensible to me. Context of use is different for mobile, but there's a wealth of stuff out there already which folks are used to consuming through their mobiles. It seems reasonable to supplement this (typically free-to-access) information with billed, mobile-specific services.</p>
