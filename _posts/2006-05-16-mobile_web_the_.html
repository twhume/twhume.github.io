But Web access is almost completely absent in these discussions. Mobile content means music downloads, multimedia messaging and, of course, mobile TV - not Web access. But the market seems to tell a different story - over the last six months, good news on mobile Web use has been pouring in</i>"</p>

<p>Completely agree. All that stuff you read about WAP being an initial failure, and then coming back into fashion recently? It's rubbish. WAP traffic has built steadily from day 1, since it was launched into the UK (look at <a href="http://www.text.it/mediacentre/wap_figures.cfm">this graph</a> from the Mobile Data Association). There's been no bust/boom cycle at all.</p>
