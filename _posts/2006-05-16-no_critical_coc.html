<p><a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=31725">No critical cocktail will force operators over to IP</a>: "<i>"There's no 'critical cocktail' of applications," he claimed. No one specific application like IM (Instant Messaging) or location based service was going to swing the balance. However, operators will eventually work out that if they want to launch loads of new services, they'll have to move to IMS.</i>"</p>

<p>Reminds me of a lot of the talk we were hearing a few years back about mobile in general: how there wasn't one single universal "killer app", but consumers would pick and choose the ones they wanted.</p>
