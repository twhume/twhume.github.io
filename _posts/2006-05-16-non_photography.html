<p><a href="http://www.nonphotographyday.com/info.html">Non photography day</a>: "<I>...an effort on my part to revive the moment by putting down the camera. It is a day to think about how life exists, in essence and not appearance and to understand the inadequacy of the photograph in describing this essence, to bring awareness of the perils of living through the view finder or the display screen&#8230;</i>"</p>

<p>Guilty as charged.</p>
