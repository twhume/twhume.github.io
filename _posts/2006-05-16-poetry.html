So I finally gone dun it. I went to a fucking poetry evening.

<p>Oh alright... I went along to SWIM at the <a href="http://www.sanctuarycafe.co.uk/cella.php?program=now">Sanctuary Cafe</a>. It was an open mic thing, and I was only really there to see <a href="http://www.hecticjames.com/">James</a> spit out one of his filthy word bursts - <i>The Terrible Secret of the Librarians</i>, which he delivered well. The thought of librarians locking themselves into underground cells and perforating their own eardrums tickled me. Particularly when combined with mental images of librarians I have known and loved.</p>

<p>But I was pleasantly shocked to find myself enjoying quite a lot of the other stuff I heard too: whether it be a man who seems to have spent 30 years narrating Lord of the Rings to himself in a darkened room, the guy who brought up "the conflated ugliness of John Major and Chris Evans - with John Major on top", or the bloke who referred to Christ as a failure who "couldn't even die properly", I heard a lot of things which supplemented my Inner Grin. So I suspect I'll be going back at some point, if only to hear a proper clown story.</p>

<p>Ah well. Next stop pilates classes and a child called Tarquin...</p>
