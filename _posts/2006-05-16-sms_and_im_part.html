<p>I posted <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2006/04/sms_and_im.html">some brief thoughts on SMS and instant messaging</a> a few weeks back which triggered a bit of discussion... and prompted <a href="http://www.route79.com/journal/">Jag</a> to email me <a href="http://tomhume.typepad.com/ip-messaging-wp.pdf">this document</a> - a white paper he's co-authored looking at IP messaging from an operator perspective, and making some suggestions for approaches.</p>

<p>When I last saw Jag he mentioned a Spanish operator who had an interesting pricing model for IM: users are billed one-off at the start of a conversation, but get X minutes of messaging thereafter included into the price. So your typical use cases (short conversations) are still priced at a flat-fee, whilst longer conversations generate more revenue. Good to see there's still room for experimentation here - and that some operators are giving new stuff a go...</p>
