<p><a href="http://www.damninteresting.com/?p=160">This Place is Not a Place of Honor</a>: "<i>There's no telling who might be around to exhume our radioactive sins in future centuries, but the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandates that warnings be erected which will warn away potential intruders for the next 10,000 years, whomever those intruders may be.</i>"</p>

<p>Wonderful, and obviously reminiscent of the work the <a href="http://www.longnow.org/">Long Now Foundation</a> do.<br />
