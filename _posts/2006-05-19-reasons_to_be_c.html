<p>Reasons to be cheerful:</p>

<ul>
<li> It's Friday and I have a weekend of variety: 2 days of fun and frolics lie ahead of me.
<li> It's <a href="http://sergiofalletti.typepad.com/">Mr Falletti's</a> birthday so we've forced him to dress as <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devi_lozdan/149212295/">the magician</a> he is.
<li> After 3 months of unpleasant uncertainty, I finally own my home; so now I know where I'll be living for the foreseeable future, and can get on with the various jobs which have piled up over the last 4 years. Massive weight lifted from mind.
<li> It was the cats birthday yesterday, and they celebrated by murdering their first bird. I returned home to a pile of feathers and half-chewed sparrow parts. Part of me is appalled at their obvious love of cruelty, whilst part of me is proud that - just occasionally - they can be Proper Cats, red in tooth and claw.
</ul>
