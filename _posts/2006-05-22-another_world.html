<p><a href="http://www.damninteresting.com/?p=545">Another World</a>: "<i>As far as researchers know, there are no fictional stories nor mythologies in the Pirah&atilde; culture. All stories are descriptions of experiences, and these stories only go back one or two generations at most. There is no collective memory of the Pirah&atilde; people; no history of their people is recorded by them. There is practically no art in their culture; whatever drawings they make are only used to describe the spirit world that they have experienced and are not drawn for aesthetic purposes.</i>"<br />
