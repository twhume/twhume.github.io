<p>A Good Weekend. Friday night <a href="http://www.wellieswithwings.blogspot.com/">Sophie</a> and I wandered out for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sophystar/149765794/">Pete's</a> birthday meal, where I got to see <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sophystar/149764531/">a few folks</a> I knew vaguely years back but haven't caught up with since (other than when I drunkenly lurch about at parties of course).</p>

<p>Then onto the Unitarian Church where we caught the second half of "Fire in the Heart" - readings from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumi">Rumi</a>. Mr Helsby introduced me to Rumi about a year back when he lent me a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140195769/qid=1148288028/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i2_xgl/202-1137247-0518235">Whoever Brought Me Here Will Have To Take Me Home</a>. As a rule I'm not a massive fan of poetry - during English A level I was sodomised by the work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Marvell">Andrew Marvell</a> and have never really recovered - but there's something about Rumi that I can't put my finger on. Anyhow, the second half was ace and the performer, Duncan Mackintosh, was extremely good: clear, warm, and funny.</p>

<p>Saturday saw me travel to Rochester to catch up with the Komorowski family. Under Martin's capable direction <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/151050239/">Nicki</a> cooked her first lasagne and we wandered into town with their friend Dave, catching a few pubs before ending up at the Tap and Tin - which isn't exactly the best club I've been too, but I suspect that being from Brighton I'm somewhat spoilt. The evening ended in customary fashion with me passed out in an armchair and Nicki being violently ill, as tradition demands.</p>

<p>I spent Sunday recovering, travelling, and doing a few jobs around the house, then out to class - where I discovered that for the first time ever, I'd rather embarrassingly forgotten my belt (doh!!), and sweated out most of the previous evenings excess. On the downside: I've knacked in my wrist again - which seems to be a recurrent injury for me, and (from what I've seen of long-term aikidoka) probably the first of a few. Typing lots probably doesn't help much. <a href="http://www.aikido-world.com/highlights/technical%20_tips/kotegaishi1.htm">Kotegaishi</a> *definitely* doesn't...</p>

<p>Chinese food and Dr Who rounded off the weekend nicely...</p>
