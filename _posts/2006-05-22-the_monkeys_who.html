<p>If you like this sorta thing, go read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380728222/tomhume-21/202-1137247-0518235">Next of Kin</a> - <a href="http://gizmonaut.net/">David</a> recommended it to me when I did the <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/bananadrama/">Great Gorilla Run</a> a few years back and it's a fascinating read. As is <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0713995696/foeromeo-21/202-1137247-0518235">The Ape and the Sushi Master</a> - an exploration of ape culture.</p>
