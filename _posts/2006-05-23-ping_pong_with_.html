Dim sum was a new experience for me, and one I'll be repeating. After a 15-year moratorium I also made my peace with Martini, in the form of a rather nice pepper-based cocktail.

<p>Conversationally we meandered around social behaviour and SMS, why mobile networking events turn into sales pitch-fests, what it's like at network operators, and the interaction design of train toilets. Well. I say "we meandered" - Robert strode off, I dashed after him panting and every 500 yards yelped "look - a badger!", but that works for me.</p>

<p>And then, of course, the inevitable crawl home via Victoria...</p>
