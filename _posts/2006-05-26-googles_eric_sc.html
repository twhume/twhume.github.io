<p><a href="http://cognections.typepad.com/lifeblog/2006/05/googles_eric_sc.html">Google's Eric Schmidt</a>: "<i>Mobile phones are cheaper than PCs, there are three times more of them, growing at twice the speed, and they increasingly have internet access. What is more, the World Bank estimates that more than two-thirds of the world&rsquo;s population lives within range of a mobile phone network. Mobile is going to be the next big internet phenomenon. It holds the key to greater access for everyone &#8211; with all the benefits that entails.</i>"<br />
