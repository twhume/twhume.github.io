<p>A short week, as Tom's European Tour 2006 kicks off on Friday with a trip to Geneva for <a href="http://aimushin.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/CullySeminar2006.jpg">this aikido course</a> with Patrick Cassidy. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/48757411/">NewTom</a> went along last year and came back raving about it, and I've never been to Switzerland before so it should be a fun one (aside from worries about explaining to customs officials why I'm carrying a bag of weapons).</p>

<p>Had a most enjoyable weekend, minimally but aptly described elsewhere in the blogosphere - nuff said :)</p>

<p>Main lesson of the bank holiday: you can't <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/155480256/">substitute marmalade for lemon</a> in a tequila slammer.</p>
