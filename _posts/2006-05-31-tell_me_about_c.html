<p><a href="http://imomus.livejournal.com/199557.html">Tell me about couples and surfing!</a>: "<i>I know that I don't really watch TV any more. I'm online all the time. But whereas a couple watching TV, curled up on a sofa together, may have felt "together", a couple surfing on two wifi laptops are visiting different sites, having different experiences. They seem more apart than together. The internet age feels less communal than the TV age did.</i>"</p>

<p>Cough, cough.</p>
