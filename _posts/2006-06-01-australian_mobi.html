<p><a href="http://www.aimia.com.au/i-cms_file?page=1492/AIMIA_MCIDG_AMPLI_v2_Executive_summary.pdf">Interesting exec summary</a> of some research into Australian mobile phone usage. I don't usually post this kind of stuff - it is, after all, an advert for a piece of commercial research - but there are some good bits in here: 20% sending MMS, and 12% buying content (66% in the last 12 months).</p>

<p>Interesting that 3 and Virgin were the top networks for content sales. I'd expect this of 3, seeing as they're all about new services, but Virgin?</p>

<p>And 26% of respondents didn't even know if they were using a 3G handset? That's lovely - why *should* they know or care, after all?</p>
