<p>If this post seems a bit self-absorbed, leave a comment or email me and I'll go get a LiveJournal ;) <a href="http://www.wellieswithwings.blogspot.com/">Sophie</a> - who can actually write as opposed to just splashing wordy lumps onto a web page from time to time - <a href="http://wellieswithwings.blogspot.com/2006/05/moth-to-flame.html">sums it up</a> better than I could hope to: Real Life right now is a beautiful mix of wonderful and terrifying.</p>
