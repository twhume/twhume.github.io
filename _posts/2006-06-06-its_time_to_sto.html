<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/default.aspx?id=2142547&nav/tap1">It's time to stop killing meat and start growing it</a>: "<i>Maybe what we're asking for, what God is giving us, is the wisdom to see that we can't change our craving for meat, but we can change the way we satisfy it. How? By growing meat in labs, the way we grow tissue from stem cells.</i>"<br />
