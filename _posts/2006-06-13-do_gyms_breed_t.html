<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2142772/">Do gyms breed terrorists?</a>: "<i>Mosques, even radical ones, emphasize Muslims' relationships with others&mdash;whether it be God, the ummah (Islamic world), or the local community. The gym, on the other hand, allows individuals to focus myopically on themselves. Perhaps it was there, among the weightlifting and rowing machines, that these Western-based terror cells really set their course.</i>"<br />
