<p><a href="http://www.watercoolergames.org/archives/000563.shtml">McDonald's Interactive Sticks it to McDo... or do they?</a>: "<i>According to Shimery-Wolf, the group had created McMarketplace, a simulation of the global effects of the burger business. It worked well for training, but in long-term predictions, business ended in 2050, when everyone died due to climate change and dead earth. The game's model, which included some of the criticisms of Molleindustria's McVideogame, showed that executives chased profits at the cost of deforestation and other environmental disasters. Adding constraints to eliminate emissions trading, tune prices to the cost of production, and disallow deforestation changed the environmental strategies of players.
