<p><a href="http://www.demo.com/demoletter/012746.html">Multiple mobile phone ownership continues</a>: "<i>Research from Informa Telecom and Media's World Cellular Information Service shows that 30 countries now have mobile phone subscriptions that exceed their population (over 100% penetration). In markets such as the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Italy, penetration has passed 110%, the survey suggests. Analysts at the firm say that most developed nations the mobile phone penetration remains stabile at 80% to 85%, but that a growing trend of users buying a second or even third subscription is not slowing.</i>"<br />
