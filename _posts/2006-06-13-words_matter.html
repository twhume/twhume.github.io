<p>Don Norman explains why <a href="http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/words_matter_talk_ab.html">Words Matter</a>: "<i>Artisan? Customer? Consumer? User? Wrangler? Biot? Each of these words is a way to degrade the people for whom we design, a way of labeling them as objects instead of personifying them as real living, breathing people.</i>"</p>

<p>I've grown increasingly uncomfortable with the term "user" over the years - for me it seems impersonal, a means of categorising the audience for a service or product and separating them from the builders of the product. Maybe I'm oversensitive but I sometimes feel it invites a "them and us" mentality... in much the same way that I suspect "consumer" does for marketing folks. I think David Ogilvy <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/d/david_ogilvy.html">said this much better</a>, years ago: "<i>The consumer isn't a moron; she is your wife. </i>"</p>
