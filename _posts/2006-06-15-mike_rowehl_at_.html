<p>Some nice snippets from <a href="http://www.thisismobility.com/blog/?p=132">Mike Rowehl at BayCHI</a>: "<i>When women text message they tend to have multiple threads of conversation bundled into each message, and there tends to be more of a structure to the message itself. Standard things like a sign off for each message (kisses, love you, etc). Messages from men a simple and normally singularly focused.</i>"<br />
