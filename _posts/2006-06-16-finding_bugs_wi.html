<p><a href="http://www.regdeveloper.co.uk/2006/06/15/findbugs_pan/">Finding bugs with FindBugs</a>: "<i>However, there's a class of development tool that can also be used to root out bugs before they happen, and that's a static code analysis tool. In contrast to dynamic analysis, which involves looking at code that's running, static analysis focuses on source or object code (byte code in the Java world).<br />
One such tool is FindBugs, which analyses Java byte code to flag potential errors.</i>"<br />
