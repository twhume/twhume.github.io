<p><a href="http://mobileopportunity.blogspot.com/2006/06/why-are-mobile-application-sales.html">Why are mobile application sales dropping?</a>: "<i>the developers I talk to are not Java houses making simple add-ons like games and ringtones. There are anecdotal reports that sales of those are going pretty well. What I'm talking about is sales of more substantial applications, generally written to run native on the device's operating system. If the phone is becoming a multimedia computer, as some vendors claim, sales of these more sophisticated applications ought to be booming.</i>"</p>

<p>So sales of complex applications for mobile devices are stalling, whilst those of simpler ones are doing well.</p>
