<p>Friday: we teased <a href="http://jay.gooby.org/">Mr Gooby</a> out to play, along with Dr Hume, <a href="http://chewedmelon.deviantart.com/">Mr Melling</a>, <a href="http://www.treesofgreen.co.uk/">Mr Hopper</a>, and <a href="http://www.daddydid.blogspot.com/">Mr Grimwood</a>. Pub pub pub, a slight stagger to Cafe Nia for a spot of food, then back to Rosehill to decomission the vodka stockpile.</p>

<p>Saturday: I stagger from Rosehill to <a href="http://www.evolutionarts.co.uk/">Evolution Arts</a> for a 5-hour introduction to the Alexander Technique with <a href="http://www.alexandervoiceworks.com/suryagita.html">Juliet Cox</a>. Interesting stuff, though as with all these things I get the impression that an intro like this can't substitute for actually doing a course of classes. Had the same feeling-3-inches-taller sensation that I got the only other time I've done this stuff, on a presentation skills course 6+ years ago.</p>

<p>Wandered home where Mr Melon prepared a curry. <a href="http://wellieswithwings.blogspot.com/">Sophie</a> and Jude's old chum Kate came round and we ate in front of Dr Who, then extinguished our mouths. A taxi to the Burt-Samuel Corp. HQ for birthday celebrations (much more sedate than <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/sets/474530/">last year</a>, I'm pleased to report) and seeing a few folks I've not caught up with in a while (which seems to be happening all the time these days).</p>

<p>Sunday was fundamentally a Lost Day. I just about made it over to Nige and Nan's for their post-Brighton/London cycle ride BBQ but didn't stay long at all. Drifted off to sleep after Chinese food and Garden State (verdict: nicely done, great soundtrack, but not as fantastic as it's been made out).</p>

<p>Things are about to get busy: next week I'm off to the PIRA Future of Printed Media conference in Stockholm where I'll be talking about digital consumer behaviour, and I'm then hopping off for a short holiday to Denmark with Tim and Kay, to Roskilde Festival...</p>
