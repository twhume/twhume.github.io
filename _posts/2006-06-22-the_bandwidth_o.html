<p><a href="http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/3quarksdaily/2006/06/the_bandwidth_o.html">The bandwidth of sex</a>: "<i>as you know, human DNA is a digital information code composed of a sequence of four bases. This means that each base can be represented using two bits of information, and since the human genome has about 3 billion bases, this is equal to 6 gigabits. So you can think of your own genetic information as something that would easily fit on an Ipod Nano! Now the interesting thing is that you get half that information from your mother, and the other half from your father. But your father's part of the information had to be transmitted to your mother through an act of sexual congress (unless you are a test tube baby), and given the amount of time it took him to "transmit," you can calculate the bandwidth of the connection between your mom and dad.</i>"<br />
