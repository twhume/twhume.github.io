<p><a href="http://jeffsutherland.com/scrum/2006/06/no-silver-bullet-essence-and-accidents.html">Fred Brooks quoth</a>: "<i>Much of present-day software-acquisition procedure rests upon the assumption that one can specify a satisfactory system in advance, get bids for its construction, have it built, and install it. I think this assumption is fundamentally wrong, and that many software-acquisition problems spring from that fallacy.</i>"<br />
