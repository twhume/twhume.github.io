<p><a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=32661">Text enforcer hands out heavy fine</a>: "<i>One of the chief complaints was that one consumer had sent the text 'Stop sending me this message&rsquo;. The rules are that the Stop command should be interpreted as an indication that the recipient doesn't want to pay for anything else.</p>

<p>Summit's response was their software had seen the word &lsquo;messages&rsquo; and interpreted the letter &lsquo;a&rsquo; in that word as attempt to answer a multiple choice question where &lsquo;a&rsquo; happened to be the correct answer. Yeah, right.</i>"</p>

<p>Interesting, and serves as a reminder that people see text messaging as a conversational medium. Whilst the logo and ringtone industry - and TV voting - might have done a fair job in training folks to use properly keywords to talk to SMS services, there's still a need to handle, or at least attempt to account for, the vagaries of everyday conversation if you're building these services.</p>
