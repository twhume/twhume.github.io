<p>One of the really really great things about <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2006/07/roskilde_report.html">Roskilde</a> was the days I got to spend lying in the sun reading 2 fantastic books: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0590660543/202-3611882-0934222?v=glance&n=266239">Northern Lights</a>, the first in Philip Pullmans Dark Materials trilogy (why no-one has shoved it in my face whilst screaming ARMOURED FUCKING BEARS before now, I'll never understand), and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0321384016/202-3611882-0934222?v=glance&n=266239">Everyware</a> by Adam Greenfield, which I'm going to re-read several times and spend a lot of time thinking about, because I suspect it's going to be quite influential on me personally.</p>
