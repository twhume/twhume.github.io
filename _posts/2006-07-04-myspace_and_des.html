<p>Some interesting views on MySpace and un-design <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/design/the-myspace-problem">live here</a>: "<i>Granted, the visual design of MySpace is simplistic, brutely exposing its content. But is that a knock against it, or a compliment to it?</i>"</p>

<p>But two things I note:</p>

<ul>
<li> The *really* successful social sites (which I'll define, for the sake of argument, as the ones I use) are the ones where social activity is a by-product of some other benefit: image sharing for Flickr, diaries for LiveJournal, etc. Compare the links of LinkedIn and Orkut which are much more explicitly social... and much less useful from what I see.

<p><li> Isn't the big win about MySpace the music-related side of it - the instant association of music with people, which I'd guess resonates well with a teenage audience and explains why it's been a hit at the grassroots end of the music industry?<br />
</ul></p>

<p>i.e. maybe it's not about "designing a social site" at all, in a visual sense, and much of the MySpace design is experienced not in the look and feel of its pages but in the constant association of audio with its users.</p>
