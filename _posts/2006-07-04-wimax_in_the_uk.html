<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/03/uk-wimax-outlook/page2.html">WiMAX in the UK. Here's why it won't fly</a>: "<i>So though WiMAX has the potential to offer high speed broadband access to all, in the UK there's little spectrum and unlikely to be so for considerable time. Pipex and PCCW will launch services, but they'll be "private" networks and WiMAX for the masses is unlikely to happen</i>"<br />
