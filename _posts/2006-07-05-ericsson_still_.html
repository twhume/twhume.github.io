<p><a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=32817">Ericsson still likes the WAP word</a>: "<i>The system does do exactly what it says on the label. It allows mobile internet sites to bill for content. So if you have a WAP phone &#8211; and a GPRS or 3G connexion &#8211; it can bill you for services all paid for via your mobile handset.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>So what's the big difference between WAP Billing and the well-established Bango? Global reach seems to be one advantage. Once you're integrated into the system, you can sell things to 0.5 billion users in 10 countries.<br />
</i>"</p>

<p>Can anyone point me to more information about this? I can't find anything on Ericsson's site. And as far as international reach is concerned, isn't this the big thing that Bango offers? I'm not a huge fan of Bango personally (thanks to the fairly horrible user experience it offers - which admittedly they've recently started to address with better templated pages), but it doesn't seem to be outclassed by Ericsson from what I can see.</p>
