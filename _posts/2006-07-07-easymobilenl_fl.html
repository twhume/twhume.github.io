<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/06/easymobile_nl_gone/">EasyMobile.nl flops</a>: "<i>EasyMobile somehow managed to buck the growth trend in virtual operators in the Netherlands. According to Telecompaper the market has swelled more than 15 per cent over the past year to 2.5m punters. Other newcomers to the market have gained ground quickly, but despite its patriotic orange branding - which Orange wasn't too pleased with - EasyMobile failed to attract enough price-conscious Dutchmen.</i>"<br />
