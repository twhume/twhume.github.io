If your abstraction leaks and something breaks, will you be prepared to fix the problem? For example, Hibernate is an abstraction for mapping a database table row to an object. Is there anyone out there who has NOT pulled their hair out because of a leaky Hibernate abstraction? Its okay to admit it, really it is.</i>"<br />
