<p><a href="http://mobhappy.com/blog1/2006/07/10/what-a-waste/">What a Waste</a>: "<i>The call to action is an inbound text message, which generates a WAP Push message to sign people up to the service. An amazing 75% never respond to the WAP Push.</i>"</p>

<p>This is a big problem for the industry. I posted a comment on Mobhappy which sums up our experience of this:</p>

<blockquote>"<i>75% sounds way too high.

<p>We&rsquo;ve seen roughly 40% wastage on services. As you might expect, this %age increases for services which are promoted to the &ldquo;mass market&rdquo; (e.g. in the national press), and drops when you promote to audiences more attuned to mobile data usage (e.g. youth).</p>

<p>Explanations we&rsquo;ve seen (and heard from follow-up research which a client conducted to look into this issue) include:</p>

<p>- WAP push message not arriving (lost in the network)<br />
- Message arriving but going into separate &ldquo;service inbox&rdquo; rather than the general messaging inbox<br />
- Handsets blocking WAP push completely (e.g. MS Smartphone)<br />
- Users getting cold feet when seeing a service message, URL, etc.<br />
- Users getting cold feet when being asked if they want to go online (mainly from not being sure how much it&rsquo;ll cost them)<br />
- Handsets not being configured for internet access (this is the most common explanation)</i>"</blockquote></p>

<p>The good news? Once a user has successfully downloaded content once, we see this drop-off rate decrease massively (from 40% to 10% or thereabouts). And it looks as though this drop-off is decreasing slowly over time, as folks get handsets which actually *work*, and more comfortable downloading mobile content.</p>
