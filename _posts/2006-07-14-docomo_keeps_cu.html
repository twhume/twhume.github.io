<p><a href="http://www.mobileuserexperience.com/?p=232">DoCoMo keeps customers switched-on</a>: "<i>DoCoMo, which now has more power hungry 3G handsets on its network than 2G devices, appears to be switching on to this issue. It has realised that the most active and high-spending users can discharge even the latest batteries in a single day and by supplying a range of charging alternatives is able to keep these customers spending.</i>"<br />
