The company plans to work with handset manufacturers, to preinstall the mobile community, carriers, to boost mobile portal traffic, and other entertainment brands to distribute content wirelessly.</i>"</p>

<p>Not convinced, myself. From the little I've used Habbo it seems to require a lot of attention - it's very immersive, which seems to me to be the opposite of what works well on mobile.</p>

<p>But these guys no doubt hire smart people who've thought about this sort of thing.</p>
