<p><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20060707/ranki_01.shtml">Postmortem: Digital Chocolate's Tower Bloxx</a>: "<i>We have a couple of points to share with developers out there who are trying to make games that break the mold. First, don&rsquo;t start without having a proof of concept stage; write a few throw-away prototypes to test the core game mechanics, and if you have time, prototype the graphical UI as well to save some extra work.</p>

<p>Second, either add some slack to the schedule or consider using change-friendly project management methods such as Scrum, because in these types of games there are always a lot of new things to be discovered and worked out.</i>"</p>

<p>Interesting summary of a mobile gaming project post-mortem.</p>
