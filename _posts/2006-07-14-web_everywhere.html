<p>A <a href="http://www.thisismobility.com/blog/?p=152">couple</a> of <a href="http://cognections.typepad.com/lifeblog/2006/07/need_a_good_sum.html">folks</a> have picked up on the talk I gave at d.Construct 2005. It was called "Web Everywhere" and was a 40-odd minute ramble about the web, Web 2.0, and mobile. There's a big picture of a pie in it too.</p>

<p><a href="http://tomhume.typepad.com/d.Construct-2005.pdf">Slides</a> and an <a href="http://2005.dconstruct.org/mp3/TomHume.mp3">MP3</a> are online. A prize for the first person to mash me up with Missy Elliot or something.</p>
