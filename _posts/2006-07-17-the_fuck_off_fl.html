<p><a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/small_biz_101_getting_things_done.php">The "Fuck Off" Flag</a>: "<i>When you need uninterrupted concentration time, you just stick your flag in the Blue-Tac and everyone knows that you&rsquo;re not to be interrupted. No phone calls, no questions - you&rsquo;re basically not there. The F.O.F. simply says "Fuck off, I&rsquo;m busy", but in a much kinder and more socially acceptable manner :-)</i>"<br />
