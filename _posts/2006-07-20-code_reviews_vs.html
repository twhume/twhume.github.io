<p><a href="http://blog.qualityaspect.com/2006/07/12/code-reviews-vs-pair-programming/">Code Reviews vs. Pair Programming?</a>: "<i>Code reviews are a good thing! When done properly they greatly increase the quality of the design and of the code. Pair programming might reduce the number of relatively local problems in the code, but this does not mean a thorough review won&rsquo;t significantly improve it even further. Chances are that it will.</i>"<br />
