He said .mobi merely presents one of many ways to adapt content for use on mobiles. However, he added that O2 would have to increase the internet-type services it offers on its i-mode to attract more custom.</p>

<p>Jag Minhas, O2's chief i-mode architect, said the firm would probably open its specifications to more third-party content providers at the end of the year. Features planned for next year include an RSS aggregator, called iChannel, which will appear high up on the user interface; and an instant messaging (IM) client.</i>"</p>
