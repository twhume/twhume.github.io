<p>Whilst I'll confess to slight jealousy over <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/fourdayweek">Ryan's 4-day week</a>, and note that despite less being more, he admits to getting less done:</p>

<blockquote>"<I>Now that we&rsquo;ve been working a four-day week for three months, we&rsquo;ve realized that we can&rsquo;t always get the same amount of work done. Let&rsquo;s face it, there are only so many hours in the day, and if you work fewer days, you will inevitably not get as much done.</i>"</blockquote>

<p>...his practical tips are spot on. Every month or two I administer myself a private kicking and cut down on news reading, email checking, turn off IM, and attack my Lists of Stuff To Do...</p>

<p>...and he's right about that death-bed thing you know...</p>
