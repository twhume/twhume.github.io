If you've not heard of it, the CC is a really interesting monthly evening held at the <a href="http://www.joogleberry.com/">Joogleberry Playhouse</a> where you get to see a few talks about completely random stuff people care about. It's run by David Bramwell (he of <a href="http://www.oddfellowscasino.org/">Oddfellows Casino</a> fame) and is really good fun. My cousin Dan was doing a talk on Sanity, sandwiched in between a woman who spoke enthusiastically about her love of Marmite, and <a href="http://www.realbrighton.com/story/1047">Fake Bush</a> - a rather frighteningly convincing Kate Bush tribute act.

<p>Obviously the evening has been <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/189319895/">documented</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/189319408/">on</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/189318659/">Flickr</a>, but I also have a copy of Dan's presentation <a href="http://tomhume.typepad.com/Sanity.pdf">here</a> if you're interested... and can thoroughly recommend a visit. The next one is in September.</p>
