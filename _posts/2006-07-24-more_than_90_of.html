<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5204454.stm">More than 90% of UK mobile users cannot get through the day without using their phone</a>: "<i>The younger generation puts their mobile ahead of television, with most 18 to 24-year-olds thinking it matters more to them than their TV. The survey also found only 14% of people would turn their phone off during sex. While 75% of people think it is rude to use the mobile during dinner, only 9% of respondents said it was unreasonable to do so on a train.</i>"</p>
