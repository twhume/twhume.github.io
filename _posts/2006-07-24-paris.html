<div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/197215613/" title="photo sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/77/197215613_b2e28d8c08_m.jpg" alt="" style="border: solid 2px #000000;" /></a> <br /> <span style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 0px;"> </span></div>So I spent the weekend in Paris with <a href="http://wellieswithwings.blogspot.com/">m'lady</a>. We had fun, stayed at a <a href="http://www.closmedicis.com/">lovely little hotel</a> in the Latin Quarter (that's latin as in dead language, not crappy Bacardi ads), did lots of clich&eacute;d tourist stuff and thoroughly enjoyed it, spent hours wandering around the city, got accosted by tourist trappers, practiced pidgin French, took <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/sets/72157594210253063/">far too many photos</a>, and achieved a most respectable Moquito/hour rating. T'other perspective <a href="http://wellieswithwings.blogspot.com/2006/07/amoureux.html">here</a> - I'd like to go back when it's less oppressively hot some time and spend a bit more time rooting about. 

<p>Oh and I read the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0590112899/202-3611882-0934222?v=glance&n=266239">Subtle Knife</a>. And I'm suddenly glad I left it this long to read it, because if I didn't have the third volume in the trilogy instantly accessible I'd have bitten off my own leg. Pullman: keep writing, you horribly talented bastard.</p>
