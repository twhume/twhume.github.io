<p>More nepotism... if you're in Brighton and fancy an evening basking in musical delights this Friday, check out <a href="http://www.komedia.co.uk/event.php?id=465&dst=1154116801">Circulus</a> (and the amazing support act preceding them, cough <a href="http://www.victoriahume.com/">Victoria Hume</a> cough)</p>

<p>If you like Victoria's work, then check out her sometime collaborator <a href="http://www.letchermusic.com/music.htm">Chris Letcher</a>. Chris has been rotating on my ipod, painful though that sounds, for the last week or so and his music is hauntingly fantastic. "<a href="http://www.letchermusic.com/BadShepherd_000.mp3">Bad Shepherd</a>" and "<a href="http://www.letchermusic.com/SwallowsTail.mp3">Swallows Tail</a>" are particular favourites but there's a huge pile of other noises he's made there, brought to you by the letters M and P and the number 3...</p>
