<p><a href="http://www.aikidojournal.com/?id=2187">The Aikido of natural physics</a>: "<i>Training, lots of it increases your chances, that&rsquo;s all. After that there are no guarantees. Worrying about details is a moot time-waste. Just train and avoid engagement as much as possible. And live in the moment. Not hypotheticals.</i>"<br />
