<p>A short break here now; I'm off early tomorrow morning to the <a href="http://www.chesteraikido.fsnet.co.uk/Summer%20School/SShome.htm">British Aikido Federation Summer School</a> in Chester for a week, with a record-breaking contingent from <a href="http://www.airenjuku.org/">Airenjuku Brighton</a>: Steve, Yvonne, Dan, and Mr Helsby. Gis have been washed, bokken stowed, bags packed. Back in 7 days with sore knees, a confused look on my face, and a hangover...</p>
