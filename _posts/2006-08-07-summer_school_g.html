<p>Summer school update: gradings have occurred, and a clean sweep for the Airenjuku Massive. Dan and Yvonne got 6 kyu, Steve 4 kyu, and I got 2 kyu. Not long before we form a crime-fighting super-team then...</p>

<p>I actually enjoyed the grading this time around. Molloy hall is at a temperature human beings can breathe within in the mornings and my uke made me look good :)</p>
