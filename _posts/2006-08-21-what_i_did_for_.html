<p>I've been away for a couple of weeks, and am now playing catch-up with piles of email and news.</p>

<p>I can't remember ever taking 2 consecutive weeks off any time in the last 11 years that I've been working (though I may have at some point). I've certainly never taken a week off without having any solid plans for it - and it's been fab.</p>

<p>Things I did:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.chesteraikido.fsnet.co.uk/Summer%20School/SShome.htm">Aikido summer school</a> (for the first week)
<li> Sat around reading a lot: finished <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/043999358X/202-7230964-3495805?v=glance&n=266239&s=gateway&v=glance">The Amber Spyglass</a> (and started <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0141019018/202-7230964-3495805?v=glance&n=266239&s=books&v=glance">Freakonomics</a>)
<li> Wandered out for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/215888049/">Officer Lurve's birthday</a>
<li> Added <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/215890987/">a new dish</a> to my repertoire - <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/215889949/">a fishy one</a>!
<li> Had <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/217111972/">lunch</a> and moquito at Havanas
<li> Took a gander round <a href="http://wellieswithwings.blogspot.com/">Sophie's</a> residence-in-waiting
<li> Went out for a messy indie night at Audio with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sophystar/219048660/">Donovan and Sam</a>
<li> Recovered from the above. For about 24 hours.
<li> Popped into work briefly for a couple of important chats.
<li> Had an outdoor Aikido class on the grass of Wild Park, necessitated by vandals <a href="http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/localnews/display.var.879179.0.travellers_trash_nature_reserve.php">breaking into</a> the karate club where we train on Thursdays: but "Airenjuku Karate Club"? Someone can't <a href="http://www.airenjuku.org/">use google</a> to fact-check...
<li> Went up to London, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/219028318/">visited the Science Museum</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/219031110/">Natural History Museum</a>, <a href="http://www.nordicbar.com/">Nordic Bar</a> and <a href="http://www.pingpongdimsum.com/">Ping Pong</a>
<li> Started rebuilding <a href="http://www.davidmarkfletcher.co.uk/">David's web site</a> (with guilt trip assisted by finally getting the piece he'd done for me <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/221086890/">mounted in the hallway</a>)
<li> Saw <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/221053583/">Vic and her band</a> play another gig at the Sanctuary Cafe
<li> Went running regularly (not quite every day, but nearly)
<li> Bit the bullet and upgraded to a <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=global&lc=en&ver=4001&template=pp1_1_1&zone=pp&lm=pp1&pid=10407">K800i</a>. First impressions: nice, but the camera optics aren't as great as I expected and it's a teeensy bit large. I am officially weaned off Nokia, though (sorry Nokia folks).
</ul>

<p>Lots of people have been busy this week too:</p>

<ul>
<li> Nan and Nige were joined by their firstborn, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/221190731/">Rory Brady Hosker</a>
<li> <a href="http://sergiofalletti.typepad.com/">Mr Falletti</a> expanded his personal empire: Luca has a new baby brother, Leo
<li> Jay and Emm <a href="http://www.gooby.org/wedding/">transmogrified</a>, G-force style, into <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/sets/72157594245605551/">Mr and Mrs Caines-Gooby</a>
<li> On a more mundane note, my dad's been transforming the hallways of Rosehill (a job only 5 years overdue thanks to my own procrastination), and we had a slight but temporary planning setback in our efforts to remodel the bathroom...
</ul>

<p>And I failed to get around to:</p>

<ul>
<li> Playing with the <a href="http://www.x10.com/homepage.htm">X10 home automation kit</a> I bought when reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0321384016/202-7230964-3495805?v=glance&n=266239&v=glance">Everyware</a> got me excited
<li> Visiting Kew Gardens
<li> Catching up with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/151050239/">Mrs Komorowski</a>
</ul>

<p>Back to work tomorrow, and whilst it's been a lovely break, I'm actually rather excited about getting stuck into <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">FP</a> things again. I've had a chance to think and refresh myself.<br />
