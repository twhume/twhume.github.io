<p>Jon at FP client <a href="http://www.wiretown.tv/">Wiretown</a> forwarded me this piece of research, <a href="http://www.fluid-lives.com/">Fluid Lives</a>: "<i>People found their Internet-enabled mobile phones frustrating from the start with technical set-up problems and confusing phone interfaces. The complaints continued even once these problems were overcome. Mobile content was considered to take far too long to download. Even those who did succeed in downloading quickly hit a wall in terms of storage capacity. Unreliable access was also an issue, particularly for mobile TV. </i>"</p>
