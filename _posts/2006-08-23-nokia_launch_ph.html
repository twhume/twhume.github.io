<p><a href="http://www.tarekesber.com/?p=44">Nokia Launch Phone Firmware Update Client</a>: "<i>Another limitation, which is the most annoying, is that users who are trying to upgrade a device which has branded firmware (e.g. Vodafone or Orange devices with their own custom menu) will only be able to upgrade to the newest branded firmware version not the latest generic Firmware version. This means you won&rsquo;t be able to get rid of all that annoying branding built into your device and, in some cases, you might not be able to upgrade to a version which has all the latest fixes.</i>"<br />
