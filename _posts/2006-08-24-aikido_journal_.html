<p>Mark's written <a href="http://www.aikidojournal.com/?id=2257">The Rough Ronin Guide - Travelling with Aikido</a>: "<i>Aiki-travel is not easy. It is often even more frustrating than normal practice as everything is unfamiliar. You may feel like a complete beginner again and have to loose some of that ego you&rsquo;ve acquired, looking so damn good at home.</i>"<br />
