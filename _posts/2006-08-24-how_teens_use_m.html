<p><a href="http://www.mintdigital.com/blog/2006/08/07/how-teens-use-myspace/">How teens use MySpace</a>: "<i>This seems to be a way MySpace changes peoples&rsquo; offline lives. It&rsquo;s possible to develop a friendship with someone you met briefly at a pub/club. Phoning would be too much. But you might become friends with them through communicating on MySpace.</i>"</p>

<p>Interesting. I've used it only to connect to people I know, and folks 1 step away from them - friends-of-friends who are slightly trusted (though not too much, given some of my friends, eh ;)).</p>

<p>Also - it seems compulsory for bands to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/223973156/">have a MySpace area</a>, even if they have a web site...</p>
