<p>I was quite chuffed to see that the <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/fp/news.jsp?i=58">.mobi site which we built</a> for Three, for their 3GSM awards entries, works nicely in the new <a href="http://emulator.mtld.mobi/index.php">.mobi emulator</a>... which Carlo has <a href="http://mobhappy.com/blog1/2006/08/24/whats-mobi-playing-at-now/">given a bit of a panning to</a>. A hearty slap on the back to Mr Skinner and Mr Ribot at <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">FP</a> for their work on the site.</p>

<p>I'd share his scepticism about the value of emulators - we did real testing on a huge range of devices to get www.three.mobi working as well as it does (after all, we were briefed by our client that it should work on <b>any handset</b> which a 3GSM attendee might use). That said, I guess some tools are better than no tools...</p>
