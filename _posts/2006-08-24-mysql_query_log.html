<p><a href="http://www.devco.net/archives/2006/08/09/mysql_query_logging.php">MySQL Query Logging</a>: "<i>MySQL has an option to log all queries to a log file, stupidly though you need to restart the server to start/stop this log, its a bit lame, it also adds a lot of overhead to your box. I had the idea some time ago to use libpcap to figure out what gets sent to the server and started the code, I've mostly finished this now</i>"<br />
