The default screen looks like it&rsquo;s filled with water. If you tilt the phone or shake it, the &ldquo;water&rdquo; will behave correspondingly. </i>"</p>

<p>This was one of the aims of <a href="http://www.twitchr.com/">Twitchr</a>, the project <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/fp/twitchr.jsp">we did</a> for <a href="http://www.blackbeltjones.com/">Baron Jones</a> of <a href="http://www.nokia.com">Nokia</a> a year or so back. The screen of the app provided a bit of data about your progress in the game in an "ambient" format: a flock of birds, the size of which corresponded to the number of photos you'd snapped. And you could tease this flock around the screen using your keypad, for no reason other than to give you something to fiddle with on your phone. I found it quite therapeutic :)</p>
