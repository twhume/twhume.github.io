<p><a href="http://mobhappy.com/blog1/2006/08/23/user-generated-short-codes/">User Generated Short Codes</a>: "<i>Mechanically, TextMarks allows you to go to their site and reserve a keyword or words. You also type in the response you want to send out when people send that word in. Then, when that word is sms&rsquo;d to 41411, the sender gets back the message you want them to. Very simple - and it&rsquo;s all free for the time being.</i>"</p>

<p>Neat. Reminds me of the O2 Escape Pods service (now defunct) which did much the same thing IIRC.<br />
