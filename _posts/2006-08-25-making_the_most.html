<p><a href="http://www.digitaldigressions.net/blog/2006/08/productivity_en.html">Making the Most of a Working Day</a>: "<i>Big projects in particular come down to planning and not just planning in the sense that you stick some deadlines in a calendar and leave people to it. It's up to each and every one of the members in a team to assess their to-do lists and decide which of the three modes they need to engage in order to accomplish the tasks and communicate them openly</i>"</p>

<p>I liked the recognition of different "modes of working" in this post too:</p>

<ol>
<li> If your work requires long periods of un-interrupted concentration
<li> If your work requires short bursts of intensive activity
<li> If Your Work Requires Creative Team Input
</ol>
