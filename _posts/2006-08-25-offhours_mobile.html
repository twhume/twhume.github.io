<p>Mark Curtis on <a href="http://www.receiver.vodafone.com/16/articles/index08.html">mobilising our meat based selves</a>: "<i>On Flirtomatic, a flirting community on mobile and web that I'm closely involved with, we see our biggest interaction (chat) levels at 4.30 in the afternoon and between 10 and 12 midnight &#8211; and equally on phones and web. These latter users are to some extent choosing a virtual night out.</i>"</p>

<p>We see similar behaviour with mobile puzzling. We expected commuting times to be the big hours for it - 7-9am and 5-7am, mirroring the times when crosswords and sudoku are embedded into everyday lives already. (We can track when people are actually wanting to puzzle because Puzzler uses a single download, pay-per-play model)</p>

<p>No way. Usage grows steadily throughout the day and peaks in the wee hours (2-3am). This is <b>complementary</b> to puzzling in the real world.<br />
