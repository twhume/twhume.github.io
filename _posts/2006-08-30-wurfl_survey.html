<p>Calling all <a href="http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/">WURFL</a> users:</p>

<p>The WURFL project maintainers want to understand more about how you're using the WURFL, so that they can prioritise development effort and make sure they're addressing real-world problems.</p>

<p>To that end I've set up a short (10-question) survey at SurveyMonkey: if you use the WURFL in any capacity, then please do take the time to <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=44362431941">hop over there</a> and fill it in. <br />
</p>
