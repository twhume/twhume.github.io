<p>Some lovely quotes from various sources about programming <a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~hottub/software/programming_quotes.html">here</a>. I liked:</p>

<p>"<i>Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.</i>"</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>"<i>There are only two industries that refer to their customers as 'users'.</i>"</p>
