By following this rule, we&rsquo;re acknowledging that something probably won&rsquo;t go as either party intended, so we need a buffer to handle the stuff that spills over. By capping it at a specific amount, though, we&rsquo;re also ensuring that the buffer isn&rsquo;t so big that it devours the profits of the developers.</i>"<br />
