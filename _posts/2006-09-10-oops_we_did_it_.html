<p><a href="http://blog.qualityaspect.com/2006/09/09/oops-we-did-it-again/">Oops, We Did It Again</a>: "<i>This may sound trivial, but think of the last time you had a project postmortem (or if you prefer a more positive term: &ldquo;lessons learned&rdquo; or &ldquo;retrospect&rdquo;) session on one of your projects. Chances are that you had some raw data in front of you, such as the number of bugs, the project plan, the different artifacts that were produced as part of the process, etc. But this raw data doesn&rsquo;t tell the whole story. It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily tell you what really happened.</i>"<br />
