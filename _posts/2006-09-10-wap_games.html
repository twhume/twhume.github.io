<p><a href="http://www.thisismobility.com/blog/?p=192">WAP Games</a>: "<i>I happened across Kalador, a portal for mobile gaming, while poking around this morning. What really got me interested was the selection of games they have at wap.kalador.com, which seem to be ports of old school BBS style games for WAP interaction.</i>"</p>

<p>This reminds me of <a href="http://www.wapscallion.net/">Wapscallion</a>. Back in the day (99-2000), when WAP first came along, <a href="http://www.bigfug.com/">Alex</a> put together a gaming platform and a load of simple games. He had hideous numbers of players and I believe the games were linked to from T-Mobile, but from what I understand billing mechanisms weren't available to him back then so there was no clear revenue to be made. Alex has a long background in the BBS scene too, which is how I know him and ended up collaborating on... err... <a href="http://www.ebgs.co.uk/">things</a>.</p>
