<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/09/11/mobile_ad_spend_skyrockets/">Mobile ad spend to skyrocket</a>: "<i>The mobile phone represents a direct channel to the consumer, surpassing that of the internet, but will only achieve significant levels of success if it can be seamlessly integrated with existing advertising strategies using traditional media</i>"</p>

<p>Hmm. Or maybe mobile is different to existing media, and existing ad strategies won't be appropriate for it. Is the same attention-grabbing, interruptive approach which most existing advertising takes really appropriate for such a direct channel to consumers?</p>
