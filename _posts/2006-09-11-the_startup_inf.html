<p><a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/?p=377">The start-up inflection point</a>: "<i>No matter how self-directed programmers are, eventually their utility declines as ambiguities in direction, roles, goals and ownership become increasingly distracting and frustrating. The company is changing because of scale effects - but scale effects are hard to recognize, predict or compensate for.</i>"</p>

<p>Very true, and something which affects any size of company. This is something I'd experienced twice now - once at <a href="http://www.goodtechnology.com/">Good Technology</a> when we hit around 8 members of staff, and once here at <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">FP</a>.</p>
