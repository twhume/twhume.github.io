<p><a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/index.php/Project_risk_reduction_patterns">Project risk reduction patterns</a> by Alistair Cockburn: "<i>The top risks are those that will keep you from delivering the system you need. Unless they are addressed, the rest of your work does not matter. The top risks do not arrive in waterfall sequence; they arrive in any sequence, popping up at any time. You will know a project based on risk management, because it will become increasingly clear over time that the system will ship successfully.</i>"<br />
