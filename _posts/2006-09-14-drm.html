<p><a href="http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2006/09/14/the_greatest_trick">The greatest trick</a>: "<i>In many ways, the recording industry is the biggest dupe in the DRM wars. They have repeatedly been sold, and have repeatedly bought heavily into copy-prevention schemes that don&rsquo;t work, can&rsquo;t work, and only give more power to the DRM vendor.</i>"</p>
