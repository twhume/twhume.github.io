I have a mobile web browser on my PDA</i>"</p>

<p>BONG! Sorry Ajit, you're disqualified :)</p>

<p>As a PDA owner, you're a freak. Don't worry about it - you're in the same box as most of the folks working in mobile right now (myself included), in that you care about the devices more than the public do. PDA owners are a tiny slice of the overall market - if you're launching a consumer-facing service, they're not usually economical to bother with. And their needs, expectations and capabilities are completely different from those of the mass market.</p>

<p>"<I>.mobi, by contrast, foresees islands where these domains do not mix; at least, they don&rsquo;t mix a the level of the URI. That&rsquo;s just not where AJAX and mobile web services are going. What&rsquo;s more, the mobile web apps that are most likely to be successful and make money are precisely the ones that successfully achieve this data convergence.</I>"</p>

<p>I don't see why</p>

<p>Shouldn't both work, providing the sort of URI-application-state thing that Ajit is talking about and satisfying the .mobi requirements...</p>
