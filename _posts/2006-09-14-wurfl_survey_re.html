<p>I've taken down the <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2006/08/wurfl_survey.html">WURFL survey</a> now, after running for a couple of weeks and gathering 136 responses. The full results are <a href="http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/SurveySummary.zip">here</a>, but a summary of interesting points I've noted:</p>

<ol>
<li> Only 21.3% of WURFL users surveyed have never contributed to it.
<li> It's used in the vast majority of cases by application developers (perhaps because they tend to be smaller and can more readily admit to using it - we know of lots of large organisations who use the WURFL, but quite quietly).
<li> Overwhelmingly it's used for browser-based services.
<li> Half of those surveyed use not just the WURFL data itself, but one of the bundled APIs.
<li> Nearly half of respondents patch it with their own data - but fewer than this contribute regularly: naughty!
<li> 95% of users rate the WURFL quality as average or better. 65% give it 4 or more out of 5. The WURFL gets similar marks for quality of data.
<li> If it wasn't for the WURFL, most folks would be using an in-house solution. So it's clearly saving lots of people time and money.
</ol>

<p>Thanks to all who responded, and to <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/">SurveyMonkey</a> for hosting the survey.</p>
