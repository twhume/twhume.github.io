<p><a href="http://www.insectopia.org/insectopia/index.php">Insectopia</a>: "<i>Insectopia is all about catching insects. The game can be played in a manner of ways, both fast and very slow paced. Will you be the one with a small collection of ultra-rare insects? Or do you aim for the biggest collection ever? Maybe you'll only go for the elusive Pipewine Swallowtail? It's all up to you!</i>"</p>
