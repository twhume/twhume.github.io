<p>Good lord - now it's <a href="http://www.amazonservices.com/fulfillment/">Fulfillment by Amazon</a>: "<i>Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is a new program that makes delivering your Pro Merchant Program and WebStore orders a snap. You send your new and used products to us, and we'll store them. As orders are placed, we'll pick, pack and ship them to your customers from our network of fulfillment centers. </i>"</p>

<p>Is there any part of their business that these guys won't open up?</p>
