So when someone checks in code which won't compile or fails unit tests, the rabbit announces the name of the guilty party and turns its ears down... more positively, a successful build is relayed around the whole office which gives us a lovely feeling of progress :)

<p>I have another post in waiting about our experiences with Cruise Control and unit testing over the last 6 months...</p>
