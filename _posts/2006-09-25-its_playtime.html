<p>I'll be talking at <a href="http://www.londongamesfestival.co.uk/Custom/EventDetail.aspx?ID=102">Playtime</a> next week: "<i>The aim of the day is to not only introduce us to the many different types of play that can occur away from the console, but also to demonstrate how emerging web and mobile technologies are changing opportunities for serious and not-so-serious play; embedding gameplay into our lives and empowering artists and audiences alike to create and manipulate digital content in ever more playful and culturally significant ways.</i>"</p>

<p>You can expect some demos and exploration of mobile-related stuff from me (of course), things you can easily do to get phones participating in group experiences, and general playfulness...</p>
