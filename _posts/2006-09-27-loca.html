<p><a href="http://loca-lab.org/">Loca</a>: "<i>Imagine that you are walking down the street when you hear a beep from your phone. You see a message reading:&ldquo;You were in a flower shop and spent 30 minutes in the park; are you in love?&rdquo; The thing is - you were in the flower shop an hour ago and then you did go to the park for half an hour! How would you react to this message? How would it make you feel?</i>"</p>
