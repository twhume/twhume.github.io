<p><a href="http://www.torgo.com/blog/2006/09/mobile-web-kerfuffle.html">Mobile Web Kerfuffle</a>: "<i>Thematic consistency does not mean you have to have the same page displayed across different devices -- it allows for different user experience across different devices but asserts that the same URI when viewed on different devices should provide thematically similar results</i>"</p>

<p>Sounds great, tho I hope we don't need a watertight definition of "thematic consistency" to work with this :)</p>
