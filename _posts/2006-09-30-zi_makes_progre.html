<p><a href="http://www.mobileuserexperience.com/?p=299"> Zi makes progress with Qix</a>: "<i>Virgin Mobile reported a 33 percent increase in ARPU from devices equipped with Qix</i>"</p>

<p>The last time I heard about a rise in ARPU that significant in relation to handset UI was in 1999/2000, when I remember being told that Nokia users generated 2x the text messaging traffic of other device owners... I guess it's (sadly) rare to see such an overt and documented link between decent UI and revenue.</p>
