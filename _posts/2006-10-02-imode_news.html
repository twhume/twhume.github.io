<p>A couple of interesting titbits from this <a href="http://www.imodestrategy.com/2006/10/061001_weekly_i.html">weeks I-mode newsletter</a>...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imodestrategy.com/2006/10/061001_weekly_i.html#61001-1">NEC pulls out of Europe</a>: "<i>"NEC's varied range of 3G devices failed to compete when the bigger manufacturers came on line. NEC then spent some time with low-end devices such as the NEC E101 before concentrating more on i-mode devices for carriers such as O2. Despite being among the first to market with both 3G and i-mode handsets, NEC's impact on the market had declined to almost nothing."</i>"</p>

<p>I'm not surprised; their handsets were uniformly awful; some of the recent I-mode ones got there as far as external design went, but the UI <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2005/10/imode_1.html">let it down badly</a>.</p>

<p>A sign of operators <a href="http://www.imodestrategy.com/2006/10/061001_weekly_i.html#61001-2">trying out different structures</a> for mobile content? "<i>Since inking a partnership in February, Nippon TV and DoCoMo have been co-developing services and planning and producing special-purpose entertainment and broadcast content for broadcast TV, which is operating in Japan.</i>"</p>

<p>It's not surprising to see operators trying out different ways of structuring their content businesses, but I don't see why the TV model should necessarily be the one to pursue; why is TV the holy grail for content businesses?</p>
