<p><b>MoMo London: Jan Standal, Director Project Management, Opera</b></p>

<p>Opera Mini has had 6m unique users since launch in January 2006, with 1.5bn web pages served so far. The average user downloads 8.3 pages/day. Similar sites to desktop usage apparently: email, news, community sites. But then he talks about the long tail which kinda contradicts this (err I think).</p>

<p>Big numbers, but in comparison to overall mobile data figures? It's the equivalent to a months worth of UK mobile internet usage, <a href="http://www.text.it/mediacentre/">apparently</a>.</p>

<p>Shows off <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2006/09/mobile_ajax.html">Soonr</a>, with transcoding of a Powerpoint presentation. Talks about widgets (who isn't? ;)) and shows off the Opera Widget Generator.<br />
