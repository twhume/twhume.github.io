<p><b>MoMo London: Ray Anderson From Bango</b></p>

<p>1. Promotion and advertising</p>

<p>There are lots of ways to promote mobile content: viral, shortcodes, bar codes, mobile ads, mobile search, TV, web sites, print, direct URL, etc. Traditional text promotion (2001-2005) worked despite complexity. 2005: simpler calls to action. Now onwards: the Internet model (not sure what that means), focusing on users familiar with mobile browsing (avoiding <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2006/08/wap_push_and_cu.html">wastage</a>, say); mobile ad models; routing around operators for approval etc. More purchasing of search terms (which Orange and Yahoo have apparently been collaborating on).</p>

<p>2. Discovery and response</p>

<p>Ray presents a slightly suspect "history of the URI" showing how we're familiar with typing in sky.com rather than http://blah:123/fred?wilma=freddy#1234</p>

<p>Similarly, technical challenges on the mobile web are starting to be overcome. Walled gardens are coming down. Sites getting better. Tariffs become more conducive.</p>

<p>On the educational side, things are moving slower.</p>

<p>He foresees a future where phones that don't work with popular sites (e.g. Myspace or Google I guess) are returned to vendors as broken.</p>

<p>Nokia.com doesn't work on a phone! These mobile companies don't walk the talk...</p>

<p>3. Spreading the goodness</p>

<p>What happens if users could share content with friends? a la early days of the web, with the coffee machine hooked up to the net, fish tanks, etc. Operators can't do this across operators, content providers can't do it across content providers. </p>

<p>WAP.com project: a bit like backflip, deli.cio.us, etc. Encourages sharing of "waplists": lists of links.</p>
