<p>Via <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devi_lozdan/">Devi</a>, an interesting event at <a href="http://www.photofringe.org/workshops_events.php">Brighton Photo Fringe</a>: "<i>Timothy Prus... will be placing his own photographs upon a wall of the gallery and all are invited to swap up to three of their own photographs for the same number of Prus&rsquo;s. This is an excellent way to not only own a fabulous piece of photography but also for your photograph to join his ever expanding archive alongside pictures from all over the world.</i>"</p>
