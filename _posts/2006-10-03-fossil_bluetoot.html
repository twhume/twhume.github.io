<p><a href="http://www.fossil.com/shopping/product/detailmain.jsp?itemID=37060&itemType=PRODUCT&iMainCat=956&iSubCat=957&iProductID=37060">Fossil Bluetooth watch</a>: "<i>The Fossil Caller ID watch with Bluetooth technology keeps you connected in style by combining a vintage analog/digital watch design with Bluetooth Wireless technology. It notifies you when your phone rings with a discreet vibrating sensation and showing the caller's name and/or number on the bright OLED display.</i>"</p>

<p>One of the things I've been meaning to do with the X10 kit <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2006/08/what_i_did_for_.html">I bought a while back</a> is to play with the idea of Bluetooth as identity - i.e. my house knows when I'm at home because there's a Bluetooth signal for me present, and knows when I'm out when there isn't.</p>
