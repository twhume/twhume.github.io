<p>Introduction from Tim Wright. Tim wants to go to the moon to play golf with David Bowie. Today he wants to plan the mission. "<i>We may need to simulate David Bowie in some way</i>".</p>

<p>We're here to talk about other types of play.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.patkane.com/">Pat Kane</a> takes the podium. Pat has written a book called "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Play-Ethic-Manifesto-Different-Living/dp/0330489305/sr=8-2/qid=1159953007/ref=sr_1_2/026-1759285-7530002?ie=UTF8&s=books">Play Ethic: A manifesto for a different way of living</a>". "<i>There's been a playful response to capitalist industrial change for quite some time</i>". We're moving beyond the work ethic as a society; the values that sustained consumerism were puritan ones: work is worth doing because it integrates you into society.</p>

<p>What are the themes of a post-worth-ethic, quality-of-life society? Play, idleness, slowness, softness. This talk has a happy-clappy neo-Californian feel to it. Pat discovered that play is a weird human behaviour. Play is "adaptive potentiation" (William Sutton-Smith). i.e. as complex mammals, we need to rehearse our relationships with other creatures.</p>

<p>3 "ancient <a href="http://www-us.flickr.com/photos/blackbeltjones/639964/">rhetorics of play</a>": play as power (contests), play as community (being social: festivals, carnivals, symbolic rituals), play as "feint or chaos" (the idea that we are "the sport of the gods". These ancient forms of play aren't that free - there's an element of coercion to them.</p>

<p>It's more complex than "are video games good or bad".</p>

<p>Pat's been obsessing about the dark side of play and games. He now thinks an ethics of play is vital: playing games makes the world less stable, more open, less predictable, more risky. e.g. Rumsfeld, Cheney using the language of games to articulate their positions: "<i>it's about changing the rules of the game</i>". Look at game theory - early articulaters were cold war theorists.</p>

<p>We have entire publishing industries devoted to organised play: it's sport.</p>
