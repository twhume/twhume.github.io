<p><a href="http://words.danhon.com/">Dan Hon</a> of <a href="http://mindcandydesign.com/">MindCandy</a>, talking about <a href="http://perplexcity.com/">PerplexCity</a>.</p>

<p>No he's not - it's all about treasure, and everyone loves treasure. "Alternate Reality Games" is a term that puts people off.</p>

<p>They love puzzles and stories and treasure - PerplexCity is all these. Season 1: the story is about the disappearance of a fantastical object. Draws on the heritage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masquerade_(book)">Masquerade</a> (which really pissed off the National Trust, who objected to lots of middle class folks digging up England).</p>

<p>But Masquerade had an end. </p>

<p>Talks about the AI game, which many folks found more interesting than the film. One of the first examples of the ARG genre.</p>

<p>PerplexCity players have made a Google Earth-style scrollable map out of the backgrounds of the PC cards. PC has letters to the editor, articles, a newspaper written by players, etc. Giving the cards away for free today, because "<i>they're a bit like crack, really</i>". Some cards have heat-sensitive inks, UV inks, scratch and sniff, microdots, etc.</p>

<p>They do live events too - a conga around Trafalgar Square that got mixed up with an anti-war march ("<i>the police don't like you doing human chains in Trafalgar Square</i>"). Gender split in their players is 50/50, age range is 7 upwards, to pensioners ("<i>the grey crowd</i>").</p>

<p>They've also launched a board game.</p>
