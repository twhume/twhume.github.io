<p>Pat Kane returns to the podium to talk about blogging: having been a journalist, he feels the freedom of complete editorial control, despite the fact that your audience is way smaller. His experience of blogging is "<i>a synergy between mental play and community play</i>".</p>

<p>"<i>For a successful blog, have a well-crafted and at first sight contradictory meme</i>" :)</p>

<p>When you blog, you don't know how you'll be used - "<i>you surrender yourself to the semantic enthusiasms of the world</i>", in the same manner that during play you're surrendering yourself to the activity.</p>

<p>Talked about enthusiasm for one of his less relevant blog posts - <A href="http://www.tomhume.org/2006/02/pissing_in_the_.html">I know how he feels</a>.</p>

<p>Talked about "<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=crumping">Crumping</a>" - one for you <a href="http://www.orbific.com">James</a> :)</p>
