<p><a href="http://www.gavinstewart.net/">Gavin Stewart</a>, poet.</p>

<p>Poetry is rooted in play. A poem is "<i>a bicycle made out of jelly, an accident where no-one is to blame</i>".</p>

<p>"<i>There's no such thing as an audience any more, just artists who haven't discovered they aren't artists yet</i>"</p>

<p>Showed off some quite amusing poetry/Flash crossovers.</p>
