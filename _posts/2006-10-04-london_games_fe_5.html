<p><a href="http://timwright.typepad.com/">Tim Wright</a> steps up.</p>

<p>Grew up without computers, blogs or mobile phones.  Talks about <a href="http://www.oldton.com/">Oldton</a>. First comments led away from where Tim thought it would go. It's all about putting childhood memories into a fictional setting.</p>

<p>Googlers took it up and started contributing.</p>

<p>Coincidences followed... Tim's dad *had* been to Oldton as a sailor! Folks then start accusing Tim of faking stuff, of course :)</p>

<p>Tim had a lot of content to deal with but wasn't sure what to do with it. At another conference he heard a lot of talk about cards as a story-telling tool, tokens in gameplay, as items of value, with suits, etc. "<i>Cards are just an unbound book, aren't they?</i>"> He also wanted to build and draw a map, using assets from the blog to create a guided tour of the town.</p>

<p>"<i>You're not sure whether people will collude with you in your engagement, or sabotage you.</i>"</p>

<p>The project turned from a blog collection to a mapping project to a card-related narrative...</p>
