<p>Done my talk. Hmm - needed more preparation I think. I said the things I wanted to say, but the words jumbled together somewhat and I had to speak at double-speed (which to a human being is probably quad-speed) to fit it all in.</p>

<p>Still, the audience got dragged through feathery ecosystems, infinite play, and why I'm forever linked to Ross Kemp...</p>

<p>Slides <a href="http://tomhume.typepad.com/playtime.pdf">here</a>!</p>

<p><a href="http://timwright.typepad.com/main/2006/09/playtime_on_oct.html">Playtime</a> was absolutely excellent by the way. A big YAY to Tim and Rob for organising the whole thing, I found it really thought provoking and met some really interesting folks there...</p>
