<p><a href="http://www.unstrung.com/document.asp?doc_id=105196">Nokia, Orange in Software Pact</a>: "<i>The focus of the collaboration is to create an Orange specific software package to complement S60 software on Symbian OS and to accelerate the Orange device customization process. This will in turn help S60 device manufacturers, who will benefit from greater cost efficiency and shorter time-to-market.</i>"</p>

<p>Handset vendors and operators collaborating on customisation of the device? Interesting to see how or if the conflicts between these two parties are resolved in the final product...</p>
