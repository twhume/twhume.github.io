<p><a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/2006/10/calculating_the.html">Calculating the ROI of blogging</a>: "<i>One issue that keeps coming up over and over again is how to measure the ROI of blogs. I&rsquo;ve written about this in the past and have been stewing over how to go beyond the intangible 'blogging is good for your business' exhortations to quantify blogging&rsquo;s benefit to organizations.</i>"</p>

<p>I'm not going to list exact figures, but in the years I've been blogging (about 5 I reckon), I've been able to directly link a large volume of business that Future Platforms has won - well into 6 figures - back to my personal weblog. Without a doubt it's the most successful single tool, aside from word-of-mouth, for generating our business... and this doesn't take into account the indirect or intangible benefits, which are undoubtedly there but are less measurable.<br />
