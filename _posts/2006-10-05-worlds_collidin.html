<p>It had to happen sooner or later... I find out about a <a href="http://www.nmk.co.uk/event/2006/10/24/mmorpg-media-space">new NMK day on MMORPGs</a>, which looks rather interesting, particularly considering some of the folks I've met recently and the Playtime event I spoke at yesterday. And who's speaking at the event but <a href="http://www.whatalovelywar.co.uk/10s/">Dr. Esther</a>...</p>
