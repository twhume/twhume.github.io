<p>According to a guy at Jupiter, <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/10/06/casual_games_fuel_mobile_market/">casual games have come of age</a> on the mobile: "<i>"A lot of market and media focus is currently on mobile music and TV. However, Juniper believes that over the next three to five years mobile games offer almost as much revenue earning potential for service providers as mobile music and mobile TV,"</i>"<br />
