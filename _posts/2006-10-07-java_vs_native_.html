<p>The Register on <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/09/26/oma_gaming_initiative/">Java vs Native</a> mobile games: "<i>Native applications should run a little faster than Java versions, though that lead is rapidly diminishing, leaving the only reason to "go native" being the ability to utilise hardware-specific features such as side buttons or jog-dials. But such features cannot form part of any standard, as by their very nature they are not standard, and the most popular games on mobiles remain basic puzzles and strategy games which make little call on advanced hardware: being used to fill the minutes travelling, or waiting to travel.</i>"<br />
