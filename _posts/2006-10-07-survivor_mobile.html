<p><a href="http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/2006/10/013746.htm">"Survivor" mobile trading cards</a>: "<i>Fans can receive, trade and collect the mobile cards by texting the word "Tribe" to a short code. A total of 61 cards are randomly distributed in sets of three, which fans can then trade with others. Certain combinations of cards can then be redeemed for cash and prizes.</i>"</p>

<p>Why not? Cut out production and some distribution costs of physical cards, make it easier to provide new ones, link in to a communications network for swapping, etc. Seems to make perfect sense to me.</p>
