<p>More from the office of the bleeding obvious...</p>

<p>I was playing with <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gawker">Gawker</a> on Friday, recording a time-lapse movie of myself at work (major discovery: I palpate my face too often to be healthy). And it occurred to me that little time-lapsed clips might be a better way of summarising video content than a thumbnail of the first frame...</p>
