<p><a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=34927">Mobile banking service disappoints</a>: "<i>most publications have overlooked the long list of exclusions &#8211; those handsets which don't support the new Monilink software.</i>"</p>

<p>L'Inq goes on to list the handsets which aren't supported. These include "<i>All Windows CE; NEC; Philips; Sanyo; Sendo; Orange SPV and all Orange 3G devices (except the Nokia 6630)</i>". With the exception of "all Orange 3G devices" I wouldn't be too concerned about the missing support, they're all very niche handsets and don't (in our experience) get much in the way of usage compared to other devices out there.</p>

<p>I thought I'd sign up for Monilink and take a look. First impressions: OW! An 11-step registration process? Look, I know this is banking and all that, but this is ridiculous. </p>

<p>Second impression: a "gateway timeout" when I clicked on the WAP Push link Monilink sent me. Ah well...</p>
