<p>I've just seen <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/southerncounties/content/articles/2006/10/11/brighton_by_night_feature.shtml">this</a> advertised on the <a href="http://www.scip.org.uk/">SCIP</a> mailing list: "<i>The Brighton Nightwalk will be a live online soundscape of Brighton at night, taking place in real time from 11pm-midnight, walking through the town, and relaying whatever's going on at the time. There won't be any commentary, so the only clues to your location will be the sea, traffic, sirens, and clubbers fighting/ vomiting/ revelling etc. </i>"<br />
