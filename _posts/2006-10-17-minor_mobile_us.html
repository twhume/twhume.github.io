<p>Here's a little something that's been bugging me recently. It's a tiny little usability thing which would be *really easy* to fix: entering mobile phone numbers.</p>

<p>I've found a few times recently that some sites (whether on mobile or web) insist that I enter my phone number in "international format". Why is this? It's not difficult to convert numbers from formats like</p>

<blockquote>
	07971 781422<br>
	(07971) 781422<br>
	+44-(0)-7971-781422<br>
</blockquote>

<p>into the One True International Representation of 447971781422, but these sites expect me to do it myself, and to bother with it.</p>
