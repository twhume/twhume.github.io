<p><a href="http://www.springwise.com/weekly/2006-10-17.htm#bcode">Drinks by SMS</a>: "<i>A generous buyer logs onto bcodedrinks.com or a venue's own website, selects a bar and a drink, enters the recipient's mobile phone number and pays for the drink online. The recipient receives a message, takes their mobile phone to the bar and holds the sms drink voucher under a scanning device. The voucher is verified and the drink can be grabbed at the bar.</i>"</p>
