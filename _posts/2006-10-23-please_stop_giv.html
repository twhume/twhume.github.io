<p><a href="http://davidrodgers.us/blog/?p=21">Please Stop Giving Crappy Presentations</a>: "<i>Legend tells of a PowerPoint goblin (according to Wikipedia, you might call it a PowerPoint powrie). It lives inside of horrible PowerPoint presentations, and when the audience is at its most bored, it climbs out of the screen and devours the one giving it.</i>"<br />
