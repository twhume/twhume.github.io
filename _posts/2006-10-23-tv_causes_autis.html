<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/10/17/autistic_kids_love_tv/">TV causes autism</a>: "<i>According to the research, heavy TV indulgence before the age of three is clearly associated with an increase in autism. The paper suggests that TV could be a trigger for those with a genetic predisposition toward the condition.</i>"</p>
