<p>There are forms of gaming beyond WoW and Second Life. "<i>You can't make computers cry. Playing against other people is more fun.</i>" Text-based MUDs evolved into 3D worlds. WoW has 7m players and has generated 1b revenue for its makers.</p>

<p>Infiltrating other areas of popular culture - e.g. South Park WoW episode.</p>

<p>Habbo Hotel - players get their own rooms, to furnish as they wish. This is a big revenue stream for the makers. Trend: virtual worlds are free to access, upgrades are charged for. Another example: CyWorld, where 90% of the teen-late 20s population is logged on, $300k/day revenues.</p>

<p>Webkinz: looks like it targets younger players: buy a cuddly toy and you get a unique code for a virtual version which you maintain online.</p>

<p>Test Drive Unlimited: MMOOR (Massively [Multiplayer?] Open Online Racing). Sports-based MMOs are going to be hot over the next few years, he reckons.</p>

<p>Huxley by Webzen: FPS, due out before the end of the year.</p>

<p>"Naughty America - The Game". I loved the fact that an MMORPG targeted at adults in the land of the free has to have such a twee name.</p>

<p>Mobile MMOs have promised a lot but not delivered yet. NokiaGame, for instance, showed potential but nothing has emerged. "<i>We're on the cusp of seeing a huge mobile hit.</i>"</p>

<p>Virtual Laguna Beach - MMORPG themed around the TV show.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.perplexcity.com/">PerplexCity</a>: spills into the real world, using it as a gameboard. Magazine, CDs, classifieds, actors at live events, black helicopters buzzing real-world players, etc. Spilling them over into the real world allows games more interaction with brands. Swords and Sorcery brands have a problem: it's difficult to put a coke banner into the game (I think some would argue this is exactly what players are trying to get away from... ;))</p>
