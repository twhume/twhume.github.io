<p>I really enjoyed "<a href="http://www.nmk.co.uk/event/2006/10/24/mmorpg-media-space">My so-called second life</a>" yesterday; it had a good line-up of speakers and some really thought-provoking stuff.</p>

<p>I'll declare a certain bias: <a href="http://www.whatalovelywar.co.uk/war/">Esther</a> is a friend and former denizen of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/tags/rosehill/">Rosehill</a>, but I found her (and Justin's) talk fascinating. I've not used WoW or Second Life myself, and having seen a few folks having trouble extracting themselves I'm reluctant to give them the time they'd need, but they look worth investigating. I got to bond with <a href="http://technokitten.blogspot.com/">Helen</a> on the this-stuff-makes-me-feel-old front :)</p>

<p>In particular the comparison of WoW and 2L as games vs social spaces was interesting. Outside I quizzed E&J about ways that MMORPG or similar might be made "casual" and moved to mobile. It was only on the way home that I realised one model for taking these games onto phones might be the one which <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2005/12/selling_new_mob.html">Twitchr</a> followed - a game which requires small bursts of attention, but sits at the back of your mind throughout the day. Ah well.</p>

<p>The IBM guy talking about use of virtual spaces? I was a bit sceptical about this, but like I say, I'm behind the curve in this area. I loved the use of 3D to present Wimbledon (complete with ball trajectories etc.) but as a general social space for businesses I'm more sceptical: I'd expect to see the corporate world use more specialist tools.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.mbites.com/">Mike</a> for arranging the day, and all the speakers!</p>
