<p><a href="http://www.thinglink.org/about">Thinglink</a>: "<i>an open database where makers can register their work for free and create labels for their products. Crafters, artists, designers, producers, and other makers can use Thinglink to identify their products and document their work. We built Thinglink for makers, because we think everyone is a maker. We hope it will make the social networks around products visible and navigable.</i>"<br />
