<p><a href="http://www.comscore.com/press/release.asp?press=1041">US vs European mobile usage</a>: "<i>The comScore tracking study determined that the major online portal sites represent the most popular online destinations among mobile Web surfers, with Google, Yahoo! and MSN leading the way.&#160; However, the mobile Web sites set up by the phone operators, such as Vodafone, o2 and T-Mobile, are also proving attractive to mobile Web surfers, particularly in Europe.</i>"</p>

<p>What strikes me most about these figures is the tendency in the US for mobile to be another means for accessing the fixed web; mobile users are going to Yahoo and Google via their phones.</p>

<p>By comparison in Europe operator portals get equivalent traffic to these independent portals. I'm quite surprised to see how much headway the independents have made, but pleased to see that off-portal content (specific mobile sites, commerce sites, nwes sites and "other") seems to be flourishing slightly more outside the US. </p>
