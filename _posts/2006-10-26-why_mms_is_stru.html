<p><a href="http://www.imodestrategy.com/2006/10/why_mms_is_stru.html">Why MMS is struggling worldwide</a>: "<i>MMS is a means to deliver multimedia messages and thus its success is closely coupled with the value proposition of the technology-enabled application that will drive its usage</i>"</p>

<p>I have real difficulty understanding what this means, but I think the argument breaks down into:</p>

<ol>
<li> Phones are mainly used for phone calls.
<li> Phones have small screens.
<li> Operators are trying to sell MMS like it was text messaging - i.e. trying to drive high volume of communications-related messages
<li> The mass market needs to be persuaded to use more advanced technologies
</ol>

<p>So, err, not much useful info there. Or have I misread?<br />
