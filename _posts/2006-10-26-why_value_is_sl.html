<p><a href="http://www.mobileuserexperience.com/?p=312">Why value is slipping away from the operators</a>: "<i>Almost all of the value in my user experience was associated with third party brands and the handset manufacturer.</i>"</p>

<p>I disagree with Marek's conclusions here - that operators are becoming irrelevant - but I think that he's right when he talks about the value of his user experience. Part of the problem is that operators are like a utility: you only notice them when they don't work, or when they behave abnormally. Billing, providing a network, subsidising a handset - all these things can and do fade into the background during everyday use.</p>

<p>This presents operators with a problem, of course,</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that Marek (like me) is an absolutely atypical user. Our usage requirements (for many applications and data-driven services) are unusual; we might be closer to the sort of user that operators want to be servicing in 10 years time, but right now revenues from a typical operator here in the UK are 70% voice, 26% SMS and 4% all the other stuff (MMS, data, WAP, content, email, etc.) So I think he's relying on anecdotal evidence when he says that "<i>numerous people use services such as Google Mail and Flickr</i>"; even if large numbers of power users do use these services, they're a drop in the ocean compared to the wider audience.</p>

<p>I love Marek's ideas around self-service though, and it's somewhere that the operators are well behind: why can't I get my phone bill or manage my account through my handset itself?</p>

<p>He reminds me here of a nice little epithet <a href="http://www.cocktailcreation.com/blog/">Robert</a> came out with last time I saw him: that "<i>if you have to have a meeting to come to a commercial arrangement with someone, you're not working on Internet Time</i>".</p>
