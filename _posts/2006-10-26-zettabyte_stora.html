<p><a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2006/10/zettabyte_stora.html">Zettabyte Storage zBox</a>: "<i>The zBox is offered as part of a complete online backup service known as ZettaBits. The zBox runs on your local network and automatically backs up data to Amazon S3. Once you commit (I'm not sure if the proper term is buy, lease, or rent) a zBox and place it on your network, data stored locally will end up safe and secure in S3.</i>"</p>
