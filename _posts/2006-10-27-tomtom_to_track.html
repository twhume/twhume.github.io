<p><a href="http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2006/10/27/tomtom_cellular_traffic_tech/">TomTom to track phones for real-time traffic info</a>: "<i>The system uses standard signalling data sent back and forth between mobile phones and cellular base-stations to pin-point a handset's location and speed, which are effectively the position and speed of the vehicle it's inside. Build a composite of all the data received this way from handsets located along a road and you have an indication of how congested - or not - that road is.</i>"</p>

<p>Interesting; I'd heard of this technique before, perhaps it was their trial...?</p>
