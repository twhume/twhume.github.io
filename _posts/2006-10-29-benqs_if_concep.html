<p><a href="http://www.designdirectory.com/blog/archives/strategy/the_next_really_big_thing_4848.asp">BenQ's iF concept</a>: "<i>The little surfaces that Gabriel White has devoted an entire blog to are about to get a little bigger as the screen expands to fill the front of the device. The history of buttons is about to get a virtual chapter as we chuck out those tiny QWERTY thumb boards. The tactile issues will get sorted and someone will liberate us from fingerprint smudges and scratched screens. The touch screen is finally developing to match the physicality of human hands. Maybe we're reaching the tipping point for convergence.</i>"</p>

<p>Over the years I've developed an allergy to reading about "concept phones" but this is still quite neat IMHO.</p>
