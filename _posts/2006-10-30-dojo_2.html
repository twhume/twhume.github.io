<p>We had another <a href="http://codingdojo.futureplatforms.com/">coding dojo</a> tonight, courtesy of our able facilitator, <a href="http://www.eventyr.co.uk/">Ms Hunt</a>.</p>

<p>I enjoyed it. The task this time was to write a simple text adventure. We made slow progress as a group, but ended up with a functioning model for a game, which allows motion around a game world.</p>

<p>I felt that the confines of 5-minute stretches as navigator or driver in a pair programming scenario led to unintended consequences... personally I felt pressured to deliver something solid in my 5 minutes, and I wonder if this doesn't lead to the now-familiar situation where we've written lots of classes representing entities in the system, but can't quite see how they fit together. Some design up front seems to be warranted ;) This time around it seemed that we had a good model done (with some bleed-over into a controller, leading to a little heated debate) but no view.</p>

<p>High point: at the very end of the evening the cry went up "<i>did anyone read the spec?</i>". Urk, no...</p>
