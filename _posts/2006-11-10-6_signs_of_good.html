<p><a href="http://mikeomatic.net/?p=113">6 Signs of Good Software Project Managers</a>: "<i>Although they are often unappreciated by those around them, they are critical to making software development happen.&#160; The best project managers are often the most inconspicuous since things happen so smoothly when they are involved.</i>"</p>

<p>I liked the list of positive activities too:</p>

<ol>
<li>Manage Customer Expectations
<li>Develop a Rapport with the Customer
<li>Understand Where the Project Really Is
<li>Increase Visibility
<li>Speak the Developer&rsquo;s Language
<li>Know How to Say No
</ol>
