<p>I had my first experience of the wondrous <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/freecyclebrighton/">FreeCycle</a> today, getting rid of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/292489215/">my old TV</a>. Advertised it yesterday afternoon, had about 10 folks contact me for it, finally got it bundled out of the house this afternoon. Lovely and local as well as beautifully mundane: a mailing list with a few conventions around subject lines is enough to keep this marketplace going.</p>
