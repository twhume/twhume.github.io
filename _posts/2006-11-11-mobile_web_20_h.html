<p><a href="http://www.thisismobility.com/blog/?p=221">Mobile, Web 2.0, Hype, Reality, and Openness</a>: "<i>How anyone that&rsquo;s been paying attention to the evolution of mobile can say that mobile AJAX being something like web AJAX is a benefit is beyond me. Like the way that WML being kinda like HTML made that a raging success? No, I don&rsquo;t think so. Saying that mobile AJAX is a good idea is putting the cart before the horse. AJAX on the web is a hack, every developer knows it&rsquo;s a hack. What makes it an elegant and compelling hack is that AJAX based websites work with the browser the user already has installed on their desktop while increasing the usability of the web application. That&rsquo;s the real &ldquo;AJAX model&rdquo; that the mobile world should be following: turning the handset and software the user already has into a more pleasant to use and useful device through clever programming.</i>"<br />
