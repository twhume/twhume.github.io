<p>A veritable feast of mobile links, spat onto your screens in an attempt to reach some sort of GTD nirvana within NetNewsWire:</p>

<ol>
<li> <a href="http://visionmobile.com/blog/?p=53">Customisation and personalisation</a> in mobile;
<li> <a href="http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/2006/10/013948.htm">The Economist</a> on how mobile is changing the landscape of politics and enabling collective organisation;
<li> <a href="http://www.smallsurfaces.com/2006/11/dont-shrink-designs-to-small-screens/">Don't shrink designs to small screens</a>! I ended at last weeks MoMo with a plea for better user experiences, but I feel increasingly that this is a pretty bland thing to be saying nowadays;
<li> "<a href="http://harper.wirelessink.com/?p=97">People are the mobile internet's killer app</a>": One World. No Borders. 2.5 Billion Connected Citizens;
<li> <a href="http://cognections.typepad.com/lifeblog/2006/11/a_global_mvno.html">A global MVNO</a>, WorldSIM, is launching: targeting roamers;
<li> <a href="http://www.thisismobility.com/blog/?p=225">Mobile 2.0</a> happened. Kudos to Mike for writing up the event in a brutally honest fashion. Mind you, no-one's yet topped <a href="http://www.cocktailcreation.com/blog/">Robert's</a> approach to event sponsors IMHO;
<li> <a href="http://www.cenriqueortiz.com/weblog/JavaME%2C+J2ME/2006/10/06/Article-on-Externalizing-Resources-in-MIDP-Persisting-Images-in-R">Externalising image resources in J2ME</a> - this is very handy when you want to update the UI for your MIDlet over the air, we've done it on a few projects now;
<li> <a href="http://about.blyk.com">Blyk</a>, an ad-funded MVNO. Russell, who knows a thing or two about mobile advertising, has <a href="http://mobhappy.com/blog1/2006/11/03/free-calls-for-ads-with-blyk/">posted some thoughts</a>. Personally I doubt it's sustainable if it's based on the kind of primitive ad models we've seen online so far: response rates, and therefore revenue, have a tendency to drop. And the first dot-com boom inoculated me against the "they're rich clever guys so they must be right" line of thinking. Still Eric Schmidt of Google <a href="http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/2006/11/014066.htm">thinks</a> this is a goer...
<li> Another <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17663&ch=nanotech&sc=&pg=1">simple phone</a> from Motorola;
<li> More gorgeous handset design <a href="http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/2006/11/013989.htm">from KDDI</a>;
<li> <a href="http://www.littlespringsdesign.com/blog/2006/11/03/local-applications-with-web-content-gmail-app/">Local apps with web content</a>, an examination of the new GMail app (which I've not successfully used yet);
<li> 3 sees a <a href="http://www.mobilemarketingmagazine.co.uk/2006/11/3_sees_instant_.html">boom in instant messaging</a> - I'm really interested to learn more about this after my <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2006/10/sms_and_im_on_m.html">conversations with operator folks</a> indicating this might be problematic;
<li> O2 seem to be <a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13133-2429090,00.html">cautiously optimistic</a> about I-mode;
</ol>
