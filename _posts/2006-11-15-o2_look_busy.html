<p>Also, SeeMeTV-style action:</p>

<p>"<i>O2 has also revealed that one customer using its &lsquo;Look at Me&rsquo; user-generated content channel has earned &pound;525 in the last three months via the 10% commission users receive when a clip they have uploaded is downloaded by another customer. </i>"</p>
