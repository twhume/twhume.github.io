<p>3 <a href="http://blogtwopointzero.blogspot.com/2006/11/3-to-exit-uk.html">might be exiting the UK</a> but there is some good news: "<i>The one outstanding success for 3 has been its mobile content strategy. 3 UK CEO, Bob Fuller, said last month that the firm will generate mobile entertainment revenues of &pound;100m in 2006, a far higher figure, per subscriber, than its rivals. Mobile music has been a strong play for 3. Sales of music via its network represent 10 per cent of the UK singles market. Historically 3 has had a strong portal and walled garden approach to mobile content but it is now rapidly embracing web 2.0 and a more open approach. Its strength in mobile entertainment has enabled 3 to generate the highest ARPU figures in the UK. In the second quarter of 2006, 3's blended ARPU - averaged out across postpaid and prepaid customers - was &pound;41.51, according to Informa Telecoms & Media of which &pound;10.16 was derived from messaging and entertainment services.</i>"</p>

<p>I'd note that whilst they may now be moving to a "web 2.0" approach (whatever that is) 3 managed to stimulate these sales of content through a deeply unfashionable means - a walled garden - which seems to have worked nonetheless.</p>

<p>How do these figures compare to those from other operators? Has anyone else seen this level of ARPU or contributed this much to UK music sales?</p>
