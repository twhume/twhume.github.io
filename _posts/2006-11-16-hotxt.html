<p>It was interesting to talk through their product and how they see the industry; I didn't learn anything much about their product roadmap (which is hardly surprising), but I have a few notes from our conversation, things which sparked thoughts or struck chords:</p>

<ol>
<li> There's an asynchronicity to text messaging which IM lacks, and which is attractive in itself;
<li> Hotxt users are surprisingly enthusiastic about the web as a means of access to the Hotxt service (though I suspect that when you're launching a mobile proposition this puts you in competition alongside a whole set of businesses you're looking to radically differentiate yourselves from, and forces you to put effort into competing with them);
<li> The Hotxt service has gone free partly to "build an audience", and more interestingly because compliance with ICSTIS regulations around handling of premium SMS services were off-putting to customers;
<li> Anonymity and control of your own identity are a big advantage of a service like this over raw SMS (where you're effectively giving away your mobile number with every message you send);
<li> As online social services grow, they're taking market share away from the dating companies - who are in turn forced to focus on niche communities to survive;
<li> Operators are really bad at billing accurately for mobile data usage - Doug told a story about his daughter Hotxting from China and not paying a penny in charges;
<li> Services like group messaging are where Hotxt plan to differentiate themselves from the competition: augmenting text messaging rather than replacing it;
</ol>

<p>Good fun. Dragons Den doesn't do Doug justice.<br />
