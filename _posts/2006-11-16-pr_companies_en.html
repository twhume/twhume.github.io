<p>In the last month, I've noticed that I'm getting loads of emails from PR companies, contacting me with "interesting news" or offers to review or meet tech companies.</p>

<p>In one sense this is great: I'm genuinely interested in what goes on in the mobile industry, and anything which means I get to hear about more stuff is good by me. On the other hand I'm kind of nervous being a knowing part of someones communication strategy - I like the idea that what you read here (when it comes to the mobile industry) is independent, and biased only by my own neuroses, rather than those of a marketing department somewhere.</p>
