<p><a href="http://www.fudebakudo.com/en/cake.html">Aiki-cake</a>: "<i>Those little people (and there are about 40 of them) are wearing authentic Japanese-stitched keikogi sewn by Masayo-san by hand and on Natsuko-san's sewing machine. And yes, the tiny hakama have miniature pleats down the front.</i>"</p>

<p>Ridiculously lovely :)</p>
