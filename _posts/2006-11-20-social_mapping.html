Maps on our phones will always know where we are. Our children can&rsquo;t go missing. Movie listings will always be for the closest theaters; restaurant suggestions, organized by proximity. We will even have the option of choosing free cellphone service if we agree to accept ads focused on nearby businesses.</i>"</p>

<p>A bit happy clappy, but there's probably something in there...</p>
