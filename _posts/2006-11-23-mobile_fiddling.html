<p><a href="http://wirelesswonders.blogspot.com/2006/11/mobile-fiddlingidea-107.html">Mobile Fiddling</a>: "<i>However, on close inspection (i.e peeking) at what some people do with their phones, the fiddling is a kind of mindless playing around - poking, changing, reverting back, going up and down menus, swapping settings back and forth, and so on - plain fiddling about. We like to tell kids not to fiddle with things - the remote control, the car controls, the radio, the computer. We often then go and do it ourselves (which doesn't mean the kids can too!) It seems we are born to fiddle.</i>"<br />
