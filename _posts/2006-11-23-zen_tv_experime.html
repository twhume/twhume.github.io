<p>Adam Curry's <a href="http://daghlian.net/scrapbook/zentv.html">The Zen TV Experiment</a>: "<i>Rather than breaking the chains of ignorance, political domination and illusion in our Platonic cave, something insidiously similar yet different is going on. Instead of actually turning away from the shadows to see the realities, instead of actually leaving the darkness of the cave and going up into the sunlight, we merely watch an image of ourselves doing this, we fantasize about doing it and think it's the same. </i>"</p>
