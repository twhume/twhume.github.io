<p>First up, an <b>introduction from Graham Brown of the Wireless World Forum</b>:</p>

<p>Children don't know the rules we set for them; this is why they defy convention. SMS grew thanks to young people "breaking the rules". MMS was an attempt to increase per-message fees. Some real views from youth follow, highlighting social value of mobiles for youth (duh).</p>

<p>Lifetime value of a young mobile customer in the UK is $20,000. This decreases as they get older. We need to connect with them earlier because this is when they build up their brand associations (catch 'em whilst they're young!). Lots of quite complicated graphs. Lost revenue through churn is far more of a revenue opportunity than increasing ARPU incrementally: mobile telecomms runs at double the churn rate of the typical service industry.</p>
