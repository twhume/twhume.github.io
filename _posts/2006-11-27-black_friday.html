<p>This weekend we did our best to kill Friday once and for all. In celebration of my cousin Dan and chum Wills' birthdays (34 and 21 respectively - mind the generation gap!) a crowd of reprobates descended upon Rosehill. No-one is quite claiming responsibility for the school disco theme, or indeed anything else that evening, but suffice it to say that we experienced punch with a kick, a welcome lack of fighting, random German sailors, at least one suspected inter-pal coupling, and some of the most frightening schoolgirls I think I'll ever see (thanks <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/306939032/">Dave and Nick</a>).</p>

<p>I threw everyone out at 9:30 on Saturday morning, looked around, and wept inwardly at the thought of waking up in the midst of what can best be described as "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event">Tunguska</a> with shelving". Decamped to Sophie's for the day, slept, watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0211915/">Amelie</a>, ate Chinese food, slept more, and finally crept back the next day to tidy up. A crowd of folks came round to help - thanks guys! - and we rounded off the festivities with a trip to the Open House for luncheon. Sunday finished with aikido and a 5-man randori... great fun.</p>

<p>Cheers to everyone who came to the party - you are all beautiful and unique snowflakes, old faces and new.</p>

<p>And if anyone has the contact details for the guy whose name I forgot who works for Symbian, can you put him in touch with me?</p>
