Thanks to FlashLite - an application that does all sorts of animated magic and is now so common on Japanese gadgets - artists take over this tiny screen and create their version of an animated wallpaper, screensaver or calendar. Or they even create designs for the menu trying to find new ways of customizing the mobile user interface.</i>"</p>

<p>They can indeed, and I hope they do. But <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2006/11/brighton_flashe.html">our experience</a>, sitting in the middle of a hub for Flash development and trying to provoke some excitement around this, is that there's limited enthusiasm for mobile Flash amongst the wider Flash community.</p>
