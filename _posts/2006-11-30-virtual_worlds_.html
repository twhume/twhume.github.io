<p><a href="http://www.personalizemedia.com/index.php/2006/08/27/virtual-worlds-web-30-and-portable-profiles/">Virtual Worlds, Web 3.0 and Portable Profiles</a>: "<i> But the current 2D web, mostly linear to linear linking, is about to be enhanced by virtual environments in which we meet as avatars, interact as 3D moving objects that takes sharing, collaboration and communication to the next, predictable level.</i>"</p>

<p>I'd to go on record as saying that the future of the web will *not* be 3D worlds where we all meet as avatars. 3D worlds have been proposed as the next big step for everything for years now, and the fact that there are a couple of really popular game-type environments out there doesn't indicate to me that the whole web is going to move in this direction... any more than YouTube makes me think that the future of the web is all human knowledge distilled into mediocre-quality 10 minute video clips.</p>

<p>Mind you, I thought Gopher was great at this HTTP thing would never take off...<br />
