<p><a href="http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2006/12/04/apple_iphone_details_emerge/">Apple iPhone to have two batteries, no network ties</a>: "<i>the upcoming gadget has two batteries, one for music playback, the other for the phone, so that listening to music all day won't limit the user's ability to make and take calls.</i>"</p>

<p>Yay. Here's hoping that all the other phone/MP3 manufacturers take note: the idea of a device which can play me my music without impacting my ability to make/take calls is <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2006/01/apple_signals_i.html">much more appealing</a>.</p>
