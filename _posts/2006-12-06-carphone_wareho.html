<p>Interesting, if contradictory, <a href="http://www.mobile-ent.biz/newsitem.php?id=24997">story re Carphone Warehouse</a>: "<i>Pan-European retail giant Carphone Warehouse is planning to pre-install its own content portal in the handsets it sells. Carphone is set to launch its Java storefront &#8211; called mymobilelife &#8211; in the UK this week as an OTA download delivered via WAP push.</i>"</p>

<p>Leaving aside whether this is pre-installed or delivered OTA (which will make a radical difference to its takeup), and the standard of execution, I like the approach: putting content closer to the customer rather than expecting them to browse around to get it. Hopefully the portal will do a bit more than just replicate WAP menus with some extra UI chrome.</p>
