<p>I came across this <a href="http://yiibu.com/mint/pepper/orderedlist/downloads/download.php?file=http%3A//yiibu.com/resources/downloads/presentation/yiibu_content_for_the_mobile_long_tail.pdf">lovely presentation</a> from <a href="http://yiibu.com/">Yilbu</a> after Stephanie commented here. Great stuff, beautifully presented: "<i><a href="http://yiibu.com/mint/pepper/orderedlist/downloads/download.php?file=http%3A//yiibu.com/resources/downloads/presentation/yiibu_content_for_the_mobile_long_tail.pdf">Creating &lsquo;Casual&rsquo; Games, Content and Applications for the (Mobile) Long Tail</a></i>"</p>

<p>And on the subject of mobile play, <a href="http://www.blackbeltjones.com/work/">Mr Jones</a> has <a href="http://www.receiver.vodafone.com/17/articles/indexcenter01.html">an article in the latest Receiver</a> mag: "<i>...in play we explore, try new things and push our limits more than in any other state. The practice of experience design often tries to prescribe set paths for the end-user of the device, rather than allow the frustrations of a free exploration of the system. What would it mean to create truly playful space in our systems, services and devices?</i>"</p>
