<p><a href="http://wellieswithwings.blogspot.com/2006/12/phew.html">phew!</a>: "<i>Tomorrow I'm going to pick up the joint of wild boar ready for marianading. I will do this for approx 48 hours with red wine, ginger, chilli, bay leaves, garlic and onion and will also use this mix as a baste whilst I slow roast it on Monday. I'm then going to make the Biscuit Tortoni for the dessert, a frozen mixture of sherry, cream and biscuit that was my favourite for a number of years.</i>"</p>

<p>Wow. It's going to be a good Christmas I think. See you in 2006, if I survive this culinary onslaught :)</p>
