<p><a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1973885,00.html?gusrc=rss&feed=1">Lots of noise</a> recently about Google and Orange hooking up. I'd heard rumours of this (without anything solid actually being talked about), but a lot of the hype sounds iffy to me (and in my experience the Observer tend to be a bit grotty when it comes to sensibly covering technology issues).</p>

<p>"<i>Google are software experts and are doing some amazing work compressing data so that the mobile user gets a much better experience</i>" eh? They have some bright folks, no doubt, but compression doesn't necessarily equate to a better user experience (didn't Pogo make <a href="http://www.miva.com/uk/content/about/pressroom/archive/pressrelease08_02_02.asp">some amazing claims</a> in this area yonks back?), and I've not seen fantastic user experiences characterise Google's mobile offerings so far.</p>

<p>Location-based searches are inevitable dredged up as the strength of Google (despite LBS failing to get much real traction so far), but launching a handset just to enable these seems a pretty extreme way of getting them out there - particularly when they're likely to rely on location data shared by network operator. That is, until GPS kit is cheap enough to stick into every handset - and I've personally been shocked this year to discover just how cheap a Bluetooth GPS unit is.</p>

<p>My money would be on a mobilisation of AdSense, particularly at a time when we're starting to see others hint about <a href="http://www.mobileuserexperience.com/?p=317">new ad models for mobile</a> that may impact on operators.</p>
