<p>(A sleepless night explains the rash of weblog posts, bear with me...)</p>

<p>So the US is about to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/12/28/fda_approves_cloned/">approve the use of cloned meat</a>; the current system of meat production seems to be <a href="http://www.jehsmith.com/1/2006/12/an_animal_holoc.html">increasingly obviously flawed</a> well past the point of being inhumane; and our understanding of animals seems to show that the line dividing us from them is <a href="http://foe.typepad.com/blog/2005/01/a_smattering_of.html">more blurred than we've thought</a>, or allowed ourselves to think.</p>

<p>I'm not a vegetarian myself (of which I'm slightly ashamed, if truth be told), but doesn't this point to an upcoming resolution of the whole way we treat the creatures with whom we share our DirtGlobe?</p>
