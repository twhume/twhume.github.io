<p>I loved <a href="http://www.aikidojournal.com/?id=2738">these distinguishing features</a> of the Japanese "ancient swimming art":</p>

<p><i><ol><li>There must be beauty as well as effectiveness in the form of swimming.<br />
<li>There is no competing with others in speed.<br />
<li>You should swim quickly, but you should never be tired when you reach land.</ol></i></p>

<p>If those can't be applied to any human endeavour (strive for elegance, compete with yourself, don't exhaust yourself) I'm a banana. Along similar lines I can recommend reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wheelwrights-Shop-George-Sturt/dp/1846641411">The Wheelwright's Shop</a>, an excellent treatise on craftmanship in the late 19th century which a friend recommended to me a while back...</p>
