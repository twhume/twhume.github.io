<p><a href="http://www.mobile-ent.biz/First-Google-phone-actually-Samsung-phone">First Google phone actually Samsung phone</a>: "<i>The Samsung deal, however, is among the first of Google&rsquo;s efforts to get its software built into the phone at the manufacturing stage. In this it joins competitors such as Yahoo, which&#160; embeds its client into selected Nokia devices, and MSN, which has similar deals in place.</i>"</p>

<p>So, if this is true then Google aren't doing their own phone, they're just doing what every operator does today: customising a handset with their own applications. This isn't rocket science, doesn't involve anything at a network level, and is similar to the T-Mobile deal: getting prominence for Google's search engine as the first port of call for mobile browsers.</p>

<p>Interesting assumption here: that the browser will be the place mobile users go to have their information needs met. I don't see why this should be the case...<br />
