<p>Another plug here for the <a href="http://www.bluejoh.com/">Joh Hunts</a> <a href="http://codingdojo.futureplatforms.com/friki/view?MeetSeven">Coding Dojo</a>, which is run at our offices every couple of weeks. Next weeks meeting will focus on attacking a problem in Java (a familiar format for anyone who's been so far), but on February 7th we have another, <a href="http://codingdojo.futureplatforms.com/friki/view?MeetEight">based around Ruby</a>, which looks interesting (and which I'll be unfortunately missing in favour of <a href="http://www.liftconference.com/2007/index.php">LIFT07</a>).</p>

<p>If you're a software developer in the Brighton area and haven't been yet, I thoroughly recommend it - it's a fascinating way to watch the development process happen at a small scale, notice patterns of behaviour writ large in more complex projects, pick up tips and tricks, and meet interesting local folks. </p>
