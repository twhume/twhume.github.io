<p>I'm off to <a href="http://www.liftconference.com/2007">LIFT</a> next week; I first heard about it last year when <a href="http://www.lift06.org/2006/doku.php/people:speakers:matt_jones">Mr Jones did a presentation there</a> which included <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/fp/twitchr.jsp">a bit of our work</a>. This year looks really fascinating; I'm particularly looking forward to seeing <a href="http://www.liftconference.com/2007/people/participant/64">Adam Greenfield</a> - Everyware was one of my favourite books of 2006. And I'm annoyed that I'll miss <a href="http://www.liftconference.com/2007/people/participant/222">Mikel Maron</a>'s talk on OpenStreetmap on the first day... but really ought to get round to catching him in Brighton.</p>
