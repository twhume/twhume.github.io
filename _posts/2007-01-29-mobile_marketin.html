<p>I found <a href="http://www.mobilemarketingmagazine.co.uk/2007/01/change_or_die.html">this article</a> weirdly contradictory... after the usual guff about "<i>operators need to put customers first</i>" (please... does this really count as insightful? Can't we collectively move on as an industry from bleating such bland truisms?), we got the weird two-hit combo of:</p>

<p>"<i>Secondly, it's surely time for the industry to bury the 3G fixation. Far too much money has been thrown already at a service people simply do not want or need. At least not in sufficient numbers to make economic sense.</i>"</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>"<i>Thirdly, it's time for the cost of GPRS data bandwidth to be drastically slashed. People want to access content - and will do so in large numbers...</i>"</p>

<p>So err unless real people actually care what radio network their mobile is using at any one time (something I doubt Bruce is arguing here), then which one is it? Do people "<i>not want or need</i>" 3G, or do they "<i>want to access content</i>"?<br />
