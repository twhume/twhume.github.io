<p>2007 has gotten off to an extremely busy start, which means that <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">Future Platforms</a> are  recruiting again.</p>

<p>We're after talented designers and developers; initially to be taken on on a contract basis, but if things work out then there'll be an opportunity to move to a permanent position if that's interesting for you.</p>

<p>As far as designers go, we're interested in enthusiastic folks with excellent pixel design skills, and possibly some sort of formal HCI background. You'll either be working solo on mobile design projects, or in tandem with our in-house team. We'll likely have a mix of work, from originating new service designs through to reinterpreting existing ones across a wide range of handsets and screen sizes.</p>

<p>Developer-wise we're particularly interested in hearing from folks with real-world experience building J2ME applications; in particular we do a lot of work with networked J2ME, so if you have experience there: bonza!</p>

<p>In either case good communications skills are important, and ideally you'll be within travelling distance of Brighton; we're not averse to distance working in principle, but like being able to sit around a table and chat through projects face to face.</p>

<p>CVs etc to <a href="mailto:recruitment@futureplatforms.com">recruitment@futureplatforms.com</a> please - and no agencies thankyou, not even really super shiny ones.<br />
</p>
