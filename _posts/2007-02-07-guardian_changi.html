<p>I'm going to be taking part in a panel discussion at the <a href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/changingmediasummit">Guardian Changing Media Summit</a> on 22nd March, during a session titled "<i>From mashups to money: leveraging location-based technologies for brand advantage</i>". I'll be up there with <a href="http://www.palmcoder.net/">Justin Davies</a> of <a href="http://www.buddyping.com/">BuddyPing</a> (who I'm really looking forward to meeting for the first time), the mighty <a href="http://technokitten.blogspot.com/">Helen Keegan</a>, and Andrew Scott of Playtxt - with <a href="http://www.mbites.co.uk/">Mike Butcher</a> herding us capably no doubt...</p>

<p>It'll be fun :) Come along and ask awkward questions, throw fruit, etc.</p>
