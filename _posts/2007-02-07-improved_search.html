<p><a href="http://www.vecosys.com/2007/02/07/ononemap-launches-a-natural-language-search-engine/">Improved searching</a>: "<i>Welcome as these new features are, the big announcement from OnOneMap was the new feature of &ldquo;Intuitive Searching&rdquo; which enables users to combine search criteria to construct a sentence that instructs the service what properties to show, eg, &ldquo;I want to buy a flat with up to 2 bedrooms for up to &pound;300,000. It must be no more than 1 mile from a train station&rdquo;.</i>"</p>

<p>I read the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Search-Rewrote-Business-Transformed-Culture/dp/1857883624/sr=8-1/qid=1170849233/ref=pd_ka_1/203-1024796-5275144?ie=UTF8&s=books">John Battelle book about search and Google</a> recently (and found it really good - thoroughly recommended), and one of the striking points in this was the notion that search is a problem that's only 5% solved. Personally I'm so used to keyword searching (and comfortable with boolean search terms, exclusions etc.) that I can't imagine it working any other way... which only points at a lack of imagination on my part. If <a href="http://ononemap.com/">OnOneMap</a> can actually do the stuff it's claiming reliably over a large body of data, that's a significant step forward for searching. It's a big IF IMHO - lots of folks have tried, and claimed to do, this sort of stuff before.</p>

<p>Then hook it up to something like <a href="http://www.spinvox.com/">Spinvox</a> to do speech-to-text and you have natural-language interfaces to search which really make sense on mobile (after all, talking into a squawk box is way easier than poking it with your pudgy fingers).</p>
