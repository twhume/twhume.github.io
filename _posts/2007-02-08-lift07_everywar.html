<p><b>LIFT07: Everyware, further down the rabbit hole, Adam Greenfield</b></p>

<p>The terms for this stuff ("tangible media", etc.) are ugly, associated with funding sources, etc. He prefers term "Everyware".</p>

<p>Everyware: post-PC, information processing in objects and surfaces of everyday life. Mark Weiser of Xerox Parc: "<i>invisible, but in the woodwork everywhere around us</i>", and "<i>the most profound technologies are those which disappear</i>". (This is what I like about mobile)</p>

<p>Characteristics of Weisers ubicomp: embedded, wireless, imperceptible.</p>

<p>Information processing turns up in new places and takes on new tasks. e.g. iPhone (don't get this one), Nike iPod. People aren't thinking carefully about the ramifications.</p>

<p>Internet of things: "I can query a chair". These things can then talk to each other: personal biometric monitors, RFID transit passes, floor sensors, etc.</p>

<p>A class of systems that tends to colonise everyday life: leading to, e.g. Jeremy Bentham's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon">panopticon</a>. Everyware does something to surveillance: there are sensors of all sorts everywhere. e.g. the Internet toilet which reports details of your turds to (e.g.) your doctor. But it could go to Youtube! Surveillance is now a product not just of our willed actions, but of actions which we take without knowing it.</p>

<p>Things that were latent are brought to light (e.g. the enforced rating of your contacts as a friend, contact or family in Flickr: you have to choose!), just as things that were visible (machinery) are being made invisible.</p>

<p>This isn't science fiction. Ubiquity is latent in technical standards: IPv6 allows 6.5 x 10^23 addresses for every square metre on the earth's surface. By 2004, 95% of the Hong Kong population aged 16-65 were using RFID-based Octopus system. It's there now.</p>

<p>Designers of PC-era informatics don't worry about engaging their systems in the absence of an active decision to do so. With everyware, implicit actions can trigger activity. But people make mistakes: we press the wrong button, click the wrong link, etc. If I transmit my location information to everyone instead of just my friends... that's awful. Inadvertent unknown and unwilling use need to be addressed by designers: how can I choose to opt out of this infrastructure if I wish to - what are my rights? None of this stuff comes up with PC computing, but a serious concern for Everyware.</p>

<p>You can derive meaningful knowledge from inference by machines. But how I, as a participant, determine how these inferences were made or signal that they are invalid?</p>

<p>There are no longer any standalone products. Anything might talk to to anything. What can we do to accommodate unpredictable and undesired emergent behaviours?</p>

<p>Q: Is there a place for fake information, for masquerade in this world?</p>

<p>A: I don't see any way to avoid that. Metadata in the wild is rarely useful for long - look at P2P networks and the quality of information in them. People in MySpace list their age as 99,999 to be funny. We need a higher quality of interaction design to cope with this.</p>

<p>Q: Does investing physical space with a digital aura change the nature of that space?</p>

<p>A: Yes. The place where I first kissed my wife in Tokyo is meaningful. If I expose that it might have meaning. What about crime data - tagging locations where murders occur. Do you react differently to a space if you know there have been murders there? Of course.</p>
