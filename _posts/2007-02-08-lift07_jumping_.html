<p><b>LIFT07: Jumping Jack Flash: new forms of interaction, Jan-Christoph Zoels of Experientia</b></p>

<p>What would be the mobile equivalent of someone tugging your arm to get attention? Would you like to take over your friends phone? How can a child leech time from its parents account when it runs out of credit?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/383593747/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/148/383593747_dd211c7d56_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Vampire Pig game" align="left" hspace="10" /></a>2 concept projects for Nokia's Innovation and Foresight group: new devices for mobile device ownership and exchange of content.</p>

<p>1. Dominant games: nice video of a little girl playing a game, she runs out of time, and her mother allocates her some of her airtime so she can continue playing on. 2 hours later her mother notices that she's overrun her credit and stops her daughter playing.</p>

<p>Right now 6-8 year old children are the fasted growing market segment of mobile phone users. What apps let kids to participate, whilst parents can keep a level of control?</p>

<p>2. Friendly intrusion ("make yourself heard"): invade your buddies desktop for just a second. Marco needs to know Angie's phone number so he sends a message to 3 friends, interrupting them all.</p>

<p>Our attitudes to mobile use are changing. Right now a message from a friend pops up an icon on your screen: what if you could do more, dominating your friends screens?</p>

<p>"<i>Design predicts the future when it anticipates experiences</i>" - Augusto Morello</p>

<p>Move from usability to focusing on delight, from usability to playability.</p>

<p>Person-to-screen interactions, person-to-device interactions (e.g. Wii), person-to-responsive spaces interactions, interactive architecture, person-to-person interactions.</p>

Not replacing the address book, but keeps you subtly informed about prospering or neglected relationships. Lets you cluster your contacts into groups, the gestures of doing this is a form of "body language". Creates a sense that opportunity to act within a respectable window is finite: your contacts turn their back on you if you don't call them for ages.</p>

<p>Oren Horev: "Talking to the hand", how shape-shifting objects suggest new narratives; tactile status updates.</p>

<p>"Phony Star" by Soren Pors: part of a fast concept development in 2 weeks: first week work up the concept, second week prototype. Lovely video of a couple miming a cheesy song karaoke-style over video calling.</p>

<p>Exploring responsive spaces: Dario Buzzini, "Not-So-White-Walls", with an interactive wall-space that can change itself. In this example, the wall displays a message received on a mobile.</p>

<p>Gestural interactions: Smart Retina, Mossa Libre and Artissima but Yanniv Steiner, Riccardo Strobbia and Jan-Christoph Zoels.</p>

<p>Smart retina: a box detects hand movements and gestures to interact with Google Earth. Fairly simple, translates hand shapes ("zoom", "stop", "rotate") into commands.</p>

<p>A lot of this stuff isn't necessarily practical, but it points the way to new forms of interaction.</p>

<p>Q: Where do you get the gestures?</p>

<p>A: In Italy there are 30-50 gestures used in everyday life.</p>

<p>Q: (Adam Greenfield) Have you given thought to standardising a library of gestures?</p>

<p>A: What is the interaction design language of gestures? Part of it will be contextual and culturally based. I don't favour a totalitarian approach; these playful learning applications are good for encouraging mistakes.</p>
