<p><b>LIFT07: What happens when 1st life meets 2nd life, Julian Bleecker</b></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/383835190/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/179/383835190_a511d24a55_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Julian Bleecker" align="right" hspace="10"/></a>2nd life worlds are made out of bits, which are supported by hardware atoms (no, really), customer support resources, energy. <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2006/12/avatars_consume.php">According to Nicolas Carr</a>, an avatar uses 1752kwh/year of energy. A real person, 2436kwh. We're not thinking that coal is being burned to support these.</p>

<p>There's also a debt to our bodies: obesity from a sedentary lifestyle, etc. (Not that in days of Wii, this is necessarily the case). Real people die.</p>

<p>How to bridge the two? Make 2nd life worlds remind us of the material contingencies of the real world (I'd argue that escapism is part of the point of them)?</p>

<p>Start by bringing back motion, time and distance into 2nd life?</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ol>
<li> Wii overlays physical controller.<br>
<li> Animal Crossing is extremely time-based: day/night, seasonal variations, appointments to carry out actions at certain times, etc.<br>
<li> Teku Teku Angel: tamagotchi attached to a pedometer: distance is a part of the game, you feel exertion;
</ol>

<p><i>Not sure I follow the argument here. TV uses more electricity than radio. Does this mean we should explore ways to make TV more radio-like?</i></p>

<p>Q: How should NGOs etc using Second Life best recognise their impact?</p>

<p>Q: There's been some research on Second Life as a place in which one projects ones consciousness, e.g. patients in burns units undergoing a virtual "snow" experience which reduces pain levels.</p>

<p>(<i>Is this real? I can't find any reference online</i>)</p>

<p>Q: If a user expends</p>
