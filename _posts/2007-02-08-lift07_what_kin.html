<p><b>LIFT07: What kind of Humanity do we want, Paola Gillani</b></p>

<p>"I would like to speak to the technology of your soul today"</p>

<p>How long do we want humankind to last on our planet? We need to think in terms of sustainable development, but what is this?</p>

<p>1. Economical performance<br><br />
2. Social development<br><br />
3. Respect for the environment<br></p>

<p>This can only occur when there's corporate responsibility towards stakeholders. We need to take action as individuals.</p>

<p>Shows slide of Kenneth Lay, "<i>a symbolic representation of maximising capitalisation</i>".</p>

<p>The alternative is sustainable management, fair trade labelling, etc.</p>

<p>Why are we here? What is the purpose of the economy?</p>

<p>Innovation is important, apparently. So is new technology. Cool.</p>

<p>An interesting slide on sustainability and energy usage until 2100:</p>

<p><i>Didn't find this one particularly inspiring but I've been distracted by IM conversations...</i></p>
