<p>The <a href="http://www.limofoundation.org/sf/sfmain/do/home">Limo foundation</a> has launched. If I could read their site (currently broken) I might be able to tell more,  Andrea has commented on it <a href="http://trasatti.blogspot.com/2007/02/limo-foundation-launched.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Handsets are becoming more advanced and gaining functions previously associated with the smartphone category. They therefore need a more modern OS. Nokia <a href="http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/nokia-boosted-by-4q-handset-sales/2007-01-25">shipped 106m handsets last quarter</a>; if they're paying <a href="http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/news/item/Symbian_to_license_fee_and_develops_Freesacle_reference_design.php">$7.5 per handset for a Symbian license</a>, handset sales stay steady, and more and more handsets need a Symbian-level OS, then in a few years time they'll have an annual bill for $3.18bn.</p>

<p>Oh alright - it won't be this bad, maybe not every handset will be SymbianOS and maybe they'll have negotiated discounts from Symbian - but it's still a lot of money. And if in the meantime processors are getting faster and others are demonstrating that you can build a handset atop an <a href="http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/RDM.Tech.Q1.07/081A0C60-AD28-40EE-89EE-D54F1024FDBB.html">OS with UNIX roots</a>... Linux must look increasingly attractive from a financial perspective, particularly if SymbianOS really is a "<a href="http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/RDM.Tech.Q1.07/6856C375-FE4E-4BC8-B753-B48AF3BD8B30.html">piece of shit</a>".</p>

<p>Not that this necessarily means you'll be running KDE or similar on your phone (much as I'm sure that'll excite some of the iPhone bleaters out there...) </p>
