<p>Half the particle physicists in the world are connected to CERN.</p>

<p>We're trying to understand the basic building blocks of the universe.</p>

<p>"All science is either physics or stamp collecting" - Ernest Rutherford (who went on to win a Nobel Prize for chemistry).</p>

<p>"We are the little difference in behaviour between matter and anti-matter"</p>

<p>Things that have weight do so because their particles are surrounded by Higgs particles.</p>

<p>Dataflow : 10k encyclopedia britannicas;/second generated by the Hadron Collider.</p>

<p>95% of the universe is made up out of stuff that isn't our matter. 25% dark matter.</p>

<p>Show's a video of two galaxies colliding together. The dark matter just passes on, the normal matter collides and bangs into itself.</p>

<p>"We can see 11 dimensions by making mini-black holes in the Hadron Collider. Which is not dangerous, honest."</p>

<p>"The Higgs is a theory. We got the money on the basis that we'd find it. If we don't we'll have to run away."</p>

<p>My notes for this one are poor because I've spent most of the talk with my mouth open, jaw on desk.<br />
