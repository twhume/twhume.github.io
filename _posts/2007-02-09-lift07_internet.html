<p>In a panel discussion about Internet addiction. Rather sheepishly blogging this.</p>

<p>Not sure I like the term "addiction"... many of the examples given are driven by expectations. A stockbroker who checks his email 24/7 because the markets don't sleep isn't necessarily addicted, he's just meeting the expectations of others... in the way that, say, a drug or alcohol addict isn't.</p>
