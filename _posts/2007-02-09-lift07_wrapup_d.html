<p><b>LIFT07 Wrap-up: Daniel Kaplan, F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internet Nouvelle G&eacute;n&eacute;ration</b></p>

<p>We've been talking about increasingly embedded technology: into bodies, buildings and spaces. We won't enjoy the comfort of cyberspace now; what we're doing will have consequences in the real world, which we've ignored up til now.</p>

<p>It's not about productivity, it's about introducing disorder (or innovation, if you prefer that term).</p>

<p>What we're talking about is assertive technology, which acts as interlocutors for you.</p>

<p>One of the ways of building ones identity is to build it against other people: "these are not my values". There's a value to hiding information, to privacy... and a cost to transparency.</p>

<p>How do we solve major global problems we face? Global warming, oil supply, etc. Consider the cost of, say, 2nd Life avatars (<i>particularly in a world with famine, say</i>).</p>

<p>Power, borders, conflict: they're all here. Some are legitimate. The long tail of politics involves some fairly nasty political views getting prominence. Problems like this are not self-solving. Walmart etc post higher profits than ever - maybe not in 10 years time, but we said that 10 years ago.</p>
