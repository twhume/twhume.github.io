<p>Something occurred to me in mid-conversation yesterday: have you ever been to a tech conference where the Wi-fi was well-spread, offered sufficient bandwidth, and worked solidly throughout the whole event?</p>

<p>Me neither. If we have such trouble doing it for a limited, tech-savvy audience in a limited area for a limited time, what does that suggest regarding the "Wi-fi is going to kill telcos" meme?</p>
