<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/100462350/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/29/100462350_1fca4a2df9_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Awfullest Slogan of 3GSM" hspace="10" align="right"/></a>I'm not going to 3GSM this year - we're just too busy (more on that soon, I hope!), so Mr Falletti is representing Future Platforms in Barcelona in 2007. But to try and bask in some of the reflected glory of 3GSM, I'd like to offer a competition.</p>

<p>Last year I came across <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/100462231/in/set-72057594065714011/">some</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/100462305/in/set-72057594065714011/">really</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/100462389/in/set-72057594065714011/">appalling</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/100462350/in/set-72057594065714011/">slogans</a> from companies exhibiting. This year, I'll offer a bottle of bubbly to whoever sends me the worst slogan of 2007, as a photo. Judging will be done by me and whoever's nearest me when I run through the entries.</p>

<p>"Never underestimate the power of intent" was my Worst Slogan 2006, for it's pomposity and lack of any discernible meaning. Can you find better this year?</p>
