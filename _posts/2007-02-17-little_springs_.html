<p><a href="http://www.littlespringsdesign.com/blog/2007/02/12/yesno-okcancel/">Little Springs Design on "yes/no, ok/cancel"</a>: "<i>n the mobile space, I frequently see the button label problem with error messages and query messages. In many of these cases, &ldquo;Retry&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cancel&rdquo; make good labels (almost always better than either yes/no or ok/cancel). What&rsquo;s most important is giving the user a clue about the action in the button label itself.</i>"</p>

<p>This is a personal bugbear at the moment: why, when an application is telling me it can't do what I want it to, do I have to admit to it that that's "OK"?</p>

<p>Is this really much of an improvement than the "abort, retry, fail" choice which MSDOS gave us?</p>
