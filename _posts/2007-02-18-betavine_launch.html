<p>I've been meaning to blog about <a href="http://segala.com/vodafone-to-launch-open-source-community-portal-called-betavine/">this</a> for so long it's probably old news now... but <a href="http://www.vodafonebetavine.net/">Vodafone Betavine</a> has launched. It's an R&D project providing a place for application developers to publish their great stuff to a community of testers or other interested folks... so should be a great place to find interesting titbits if you're that way inclined. I was dead chuffed to have a chance to contribute to the project at one of the early-ish planning meetings - the fact that Voda was going out there and asking for opinion in the first place was A Really Good Thing IMHO, and a breath of fresh air after the fairly closed "Via" programme they ran for developer relationships.</p>
