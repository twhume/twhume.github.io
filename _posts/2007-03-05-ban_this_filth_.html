<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/03/05/jedi_speak_out_on_uk_sword_law/">There's a proposal out</a> to ban "samurai swords". Why is it always "samurai swords", I wonder? Are they innately more dangerous than a broadsword, or are they just the nutters' weapon of choice?</p>

<p>Anyhow, as someone who's still working on being a jedi but occasionally likes to swing a wooden bokken around in the garden, or walks/drives/flies to courses with a bag of assorted, this makes me slightly nervous. It seems only a short step away from banning anything brown and sticky, when I'm sure there are more effective (but perhaps less headline-worthy) steps that could be taken to protect the public from the insane. I'm guessing that it's only the insane this law is targeting - criminals aren't known for their rigid adherence to the rule of law.</p>

<p>So for what it's worth (which tends towards zero over time) I've signed the <a href="http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/swords/">e-petition asking the vicar to reconsider</a>, and if you care about this sort of stuff, I urge you to too.</p>

<p>Psst - mind you, those guys with katana perched on the living room wall are a bit strange, aren't you^H^H^Hthey? ;)<br />
