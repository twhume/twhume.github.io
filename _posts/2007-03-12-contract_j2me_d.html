<p>Just a reminder: Future Platforms are still looking for J2ME developers to work from our offices in Brighton.</p>

<p>We're initially after some folk for an immediate short-term contract; but if our current busy spell continues (and we'd expect it to) then we'd look to transition to full-time employment after a few months.</p>

<p>Please send CVs to <a href="mailto:recruitment@futureplatforms.com">recruitment@futureplatforms.com</a>.</p>
