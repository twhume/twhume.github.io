<p>The <a href="http://www.brightoncodingdojo.co.uk/index.html">Brighton Coding Dojo Night</a> offers "<i>an exciting opportunity to collaborate with others to explore group computer programming - where groups of people work together to create a single program. This event hopes to bring together a mix of public, students and professionals looking to explore creative group coding in a unique atmosphere. Although some basic knowledge of programming concepts is preferred, you do not need to be proficient in any one language.</i>"</p>

<p>I'm really looking forward to this :)</p>
