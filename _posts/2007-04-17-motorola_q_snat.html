<p>Interesting. Some of the clunkiness I see in interface design seems to come from where creators:</p>

<ol>
<li> Invent a great metaphor for a task or collection of tasks ("let's treat addresses like rolodex cards")
<li> Carry this metaphor through in a manner completely consistent with that metaphor ("consistency is Good Thing mmmkay")
<li> End up with a completely implemented, consistency and conceptually elegant metaphor that doesn't let you actually <b>do stuff quick</b>.
</ol>

<p>Desktops, with their endless drive to take paper concepts and digitise them, seem to be particularly bad for this.<br />
