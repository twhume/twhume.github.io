<p>Yay! Congratulations are definitely due to <a href="http://wellieswithwings.blogspot.com/">the lovely Sophie</a> and the <a href="http://www.clearleft.com/">Clearleft</a> guys, both of whom have <a href="http://wellieswithwings.blogspot.com/2007/04/exciting-update.html#links">Done The Right Thing</a>: "<i>on the 14th May I start as Studio Manager/Project Assistant at Clearleft. I am a combination of very excited and a just a little bit scared.</i>"</p>

<p>By utter coincidence, ClearLeft and <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">Future Platforms</a> are collaborating on a rather special GPS gaming project at the moment... it should be an interesting few months :)</p>
