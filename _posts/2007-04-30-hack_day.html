<p><a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2007/04/who_are_we_hoping_wil/">Hack Day looks good fun</a>: "<i>But I'm also definitely hoping that we'll get groups along from people interested in weird interactive art projects like the ones that Regine Debatty talks about at We Make Money Not Art or some of the really awesome people who make stuff at the RCA's Interaction design course. I'm hoping that people interested in Everyware and the kinds of physical stuff that Schulze & Webb and ThingM put together will also think about coming.</i>"<br />
