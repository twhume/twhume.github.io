<p>A lovely genre-spanning post from the <a href="http://www.appelsiini.net/keitai-l/">Keitai-L</a> list on a possible relationship between animism and an acceptance of ubiquitous computing in Japanese culture. Unfortunately this post hasn't made it into the archives of the list yet, so here it is in full; it's from <a href="www.thechinaventure.com">Robert Osazuwa Ness</a>:</p>

<blockquote>"<i>Shintoism's concept of place and things and implications to  
applications of
ubicomp and location-based mobile technology.

<p>Shinto involves the worship of kami (&#31070;), or gods.  According to  <br />
Wikipedia,<br />
"Some kami are local and can be regarded as the spirit or genius of a<br />
particular place, but other ones represent major natural objects and<br />
processes".  This is a cultural and religious contribution to the<br />
conversation on the relationship between the virtual world and the  <br />
real.<br />
Kami can be defined as virtual objects because they cannot be  <br />
perceived<br />
through the naked senses, but are nonetheless we perceive them  <br />
mentally and<br />
they have specific qualities in our imaginations.  A kami is a body of<br />
virtual qualities ascribed to a physical object or place.</p>

<p>Locational and object-based characteristics of Shintoism originated in<br />
shamanic beliefs brought from the Continent (China) and the Korean<br />
peninsula.  At first this was worship of kami who inhabited things.<br />
Ceremonies were held outside before iwakuras, a small space or  <br />
alter made<br />
of  stones.  After the arrival of Buddhism, the idea of building  <br />
"houses"<br />
for kami arose and shrines were built.</p>

<p>The development of Shintoism has been intertwined with Chinese  <br />
Buddhism as<br />
well as other Chinese philosophies, and is generally part of the<br />
Chinese-born idea of a monist nature of existence (&#22825;&#20154;&#21512;&#19968;, man  <br />
and nature are<br />
one) that has influenced many belief systems in East Asia (though  <br />
it should<br />
be point out that this way of thinking has largely been lost in  <br />
present day<br />
China).</p>

<p>The most interestingly theme in Shintoism is reverence for nature and<br />
natural beauty.  Thus kami are ascribed to objects and places that are<br />
striking in their natural beauty.  More interestingly, Wikipedia  <br />
quotes, "As<br />
time went by, the original nature-worshipping roots of the  <br />
religion, while<br />
never lost entirely, became attenuated and the kami took on more  <br />
reified and<br />
anthropomorphic forms, with a formidable corpus of myth attached to  <br />
them."<br />
I feel this implies that kami could easily be perceived in urban  <br />
settings,<br />
especially with high-tech themes.  Moreover, the reification,<br />
anthropomorphism, and myth have direct implications to digital  <br />
installation,<br />
and story-based events such as urban gaming.</p>

<p>Modern day Shinto is better viewed as a cultural mindset than as a<br />
religion.  In other words, it is an implicit factor affecting  <br />
behavior,<br />
rather than an explicit set of goals (such as do something so you  <br />
can get to<br />
Heaven and avoid Hell).  This is highlighted in the fact that  <br />
expressed<br />
belief in Shinto as a dogmatic religion has declined since the War  <br />
while use<br />
of Shinto artifacts, participation in ceremonies, and other Shinto  <br />
practices<br />
have remained popular.</p>

<p>The implication here is a unique cultural openness of the Japanese to<br />
growing Ubicomp applications.  The kami represent a cultural  <br />
precedent for<br />
ascribing virtual qualities to real objects.  The fact that  <br />
Shintoism is a<br />
way of thinking rather than a dogmatic religion has the potential for<br />
innovating on Shinto concepts in the design of Ubicomp and location- <br />
based<br />
applications without fear of treading on the sacred (although  <br />
sensitivity<br />
and respect are still required).<br />
