<p>I'm camped out at <a href="http://pmn.co.uk/mex/">MEX</a> for 2 days, wearing my analyst/blogger and FP hats.</p>

<p>It's been interesting so far - great bunch of folks, an intimate atmosphere, good venue, and some familiar faces. I like the format too - talks or panel discussions with frequent breakout sessions.</p>

<p>I'm here as a guest to take notes formally, so won't be publishing an exhaustive report, but some impressions and thoughts so far:</p>

<ol>
<li> Cliff Crosbie of Nokia was excellent talking about the importance of the retail environment, though we weren't clear what percentage of handsets are sold via this channel nowadays. Message: if you want to sell these products, make sure your sales force are knowledgeable, confident, and appropriately incentivised.
<li> <a href="http://www.160characters.org/">Mike Grenville</a>'s break-out session on retail, where we concluded that we need simple pricing, building trust by letting users try things out, and across-the-value-chain incentives so that sales staff benefit from educating customers about mobile data services.
<li> The Prada phone has sold very well, and (coincidentally) has the strictest ever guidelines for retail display.
<li> There's a contradiction between wanting openness in all business dealings, and a well-integrated user experience running from content, through handset, to network.
<li> Big Brother vids generated 50x the traffic for Vodafone live and 10x as much revenue when they were made free to download as when they were sold.
<li> Vodafone see mobile as a satellite of fixed Internet use nowadays, apparently.
<li> The address book keeps being mentioned as a gateway to Internet services: score one, <a href="http://3dpeople.blogspot.com/">Mr Johnston</a> :)
<li> Telecomms is Apple-obsessed right now, and (I think) ignoring that fact that the products their jealous of (ipod, Walkman) are all single-use devices whilst mobile is general purpose.
<li> <a href="http://www.christianlindholm.com/">Christian Lindholm</a>: "<i>Skype is interesting because of its intergenerational appeal</i>"
<li> Contextual UIs which take the environment into account are (a) hard and (b) of questionable value.
</ol>

<p>All this, and <a href="http://anti-mega.com/antimega/">Mr Heathcote</a> lurking in amongst a crowd of on-brand Happy People in Nokia presentation...</p>
