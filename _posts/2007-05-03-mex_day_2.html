<p>More bits and pieces from <a href="http://www.pmn.co.uk/">MEX</a> <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2007/05/mex_day_1.html">since my last post</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li> What's the cost to the operator or handset vendor of adding in context-aware features, compared to the (commercial) benefit?
<li> 61% of women carry a phone in their handback. 60% of men in right trouser pocket.
<li> A great presentation from <a href="http://www.argogroup.com/">Argo Group</a> showing off real-world results from their test suite: response times for text messages during NYE, what happens when things go wrong with MMS delivery: "<i>you need to think like the user, test like an engineer</i>"
<li> Fantastic break-out session with <a href="http://www.christianlindholm.com/">Christian Lindholm</a>, <a href="http://www.usableproducts.com/whoWeAre/scott.shtml">Scott Weiss</a> and chums: including revelations about large internet portals taking a more scientific approach to usability than handset vendors; the need of insight and intuition to make great products (whereas usability can get you to "good"); 
<li> Measuring device usability by counting numbers of support calls generated;
<li> Christian wondering out loud why the Motorola Z8 has such a Series-60 like UI during a panel session including Matthew Menz, Head of Interaction Design at Motorola :)
<li> Annti Ohrling of <a href="http://www.blyk.com/">Blyk</a> talking about their research and their intention to concentrate on text-message push marketing
</ol>

<p>All this, and a verbal kicking from <a href="http://www.tripleodeon.com/">James Pearce</a> too, after I ventured the idea that fragmentation (as a consequence of open standards) was in one way an opportunity for companies like FP (or others who are out there solving device fragmentation problems - Argo Group, Volantis, etc.). Never been told that I should be ashamed of myself by a speaker at a conference before :)</p>

<p>Nice to catch up with you afterwards tho James :)</p>
