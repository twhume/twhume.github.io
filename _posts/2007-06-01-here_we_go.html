<p>In 2 hours time we're launching a ghost detector for mobile phones. We've done this before, but there's a couple of differences here:</p>

<ol>
<li> It's in the US - our first project across the pond
<li> It's tied into a live TV broadcast going out on Discovery. 
</ol>

<p>A core team of FP all-stars are lurking in the office, with others popping in throughout the night. We'll be here til 8am or so GMT... wish us luck (and don't expect me to be coherent tomorrow)</p>
