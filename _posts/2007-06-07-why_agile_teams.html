<p><a href="http://www.eventyr.co.uk/">Joh</a> and I wandered up to <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/why-agile-teams-fail">Why Agile Teams Fail</a>, an evening event being run by Skills Matter last night. The top was self-explanatory - what goes wrong with all this terribly fashionable agile business?</p>

<p>The overall message seemed to be "<i>if it doesn't work, you aren't doing it right, or your people aren't any cop</i>" which didn't seem to be massively helpful. But I found lots of interesting stuff in the detail: Erik pulled out lots of interesting facts from the experience of <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">Thoughtworks</a>; some of these I've documented in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/sets/72157600322425182/">Flickr photoset</a> where most of my notes live, a few others here:</p>

<ul>
<li> Pair programming can be better sold to sceptical upstream management ("<i>what? you mean we'll halve productivity?</i>") as "constant code reviews";
<li> Software is never finished;
<li> True weekly iterations don't often happen, but iterations where each discipline does a weeks work then hands it on (analysts to developers to QA) are more common; I'm still not sure how you balance the fact that a weeks analyst work might lead to 3 weeks development which might lead to 5 weeks QA tho...
<li> Story points (something I've often failed to grasp the point of) are if nothing else, a good way to avoid confusing the "ideal effort days" estimates are written in with "actual productive days" that you end up dealing with;
</ul>

<p>A shame that by the end of the talk, the room was sauna-like and we had to run back to Brighton, I would have liked to have nattered more but just didn't have the time. Maybe at the upcoming <a href="http://www.agileforum.co.uk/agileforum/">Brighton Agile Forum</a>, eh?</p>
