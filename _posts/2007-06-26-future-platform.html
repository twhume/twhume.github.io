<p>We've had a busy 6 months, and thanks to a rapidly filling pipeline of work we're looking to recruit again, in a few specific areas. Email <a href="mailto:recruitment@futureplatforms.com">recruitment@futureplatforms.com</a> if these sound like you.</p>

<p><b>Technical project manager</b></p>

<p>We're after either a project manager with experience herding a team of software developers, or someone with strong organisational and communications skills looking to move from development into project management. In either case you'll need to be comfortable dealing with the in-depth technical details of complex software projects. You'll be responsible for managing and motivating teams of developers and designers, writing project plans, liaising directly with clients and tracking progress. Any experience you have managing application development for mobile would be absolutely super.</p>

<p>This position is to be full-time and contract initially; after a successful probation period we would look to transition into a permanent position.</p>

<p><b>Senior designer</b></p>

<p>We're looking for someone who's got a strong track record of mobile design, with an in-depth understanding of the technical constraints of mobile. Excellent skills originating and implementing visuals is essential, backed up with solid interaction design thinking. If you've gone so far as building WAP or XHTML sites, that'd be a bonus.</p>

<p>You'll be contributing to a multidisciplinary team working for a broad client base; over the last 6 months we've carried out projects for Nokia, the BBC, Hotxt, Discovery US, BAA and Robbie Williams. As well as hands-on design work we'll expect you to get involved with pitches and contribute to proposals, help us hone our approach and processes, and develop our design capability.</p>

<p>This position is full-time and permanent.</p>

<p><b>Software developers</b></p>

<p>You'll have solid Java experience and be comfortable with either developing efficient, reliable software running within restricted environments for mobile phones, or working on server-side applications using Tomcat, Hibernate and MySQL. If you can do both, we'll be especially interested in talking to you. An eye for detail and a professional, methodical approach towards software engineering will be essential.</p>

<p>This position is to be full-time and contract initially; after a successful probation period we would look to transition to a permanent position. </p>

<p>There's a load more information about us at our <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/fp/contact_us/careers/">web site</a>, but if you're reading here you probably already know that :)</p>

<p><b>Strictly no agencies please</b>. Honestly: if you're an agency, please don't contact us, you'll only make us angry.</p>
