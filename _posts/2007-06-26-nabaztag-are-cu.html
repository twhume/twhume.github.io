<p>Just had this email from the folks at Nabaztag:</p>

<blockquote>
"<i>We're choking up a bit. There's a few tear drops on our cheecks. Sadness? Anxiety? Really, it's both. Because it's been a while since Twh, your Nabaztag, that cute little Rabbit in your life, has given even the smallest sign of life! Please, so we can go on, so we can be happy... reassure us, tell us what's up.</i>"
</blockquote>

<p>Sweet that they do this - that they watch for a customer (me) who's long since paid them any cash, keep an eye on me, and then both to contact me to offer support.</p>
