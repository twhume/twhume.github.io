<p>A reminder - <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">we're</a> still looking for a permanent senior designer and/or freelancers with mobile experience to join us here at FP. We're exceptionally busy at the moment, so if you fancy coming to sunny Brighton and working on (a) interaction and visual design for an increasing number of consumer-facing mobile apps and WAP sites, plus (b) prototype and proof-of-concepts for some really smart, interesting clients... email recruitment at futureplatforms dot com with a CV.</p>
