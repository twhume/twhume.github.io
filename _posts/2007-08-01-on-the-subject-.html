<p>...I'm going to be in San Francisco for a couple of days either side of our trip to the desert later this month. If you're in the vicinity and fancy catching up, leave a comment or drop me an email. I've only been to the US once before, so (the customs experience aside) I'm getting very excited :)</p>
