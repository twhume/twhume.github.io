<p>If anyone's looking for a Technical Writer, drop me a comment or an email. I have a friend who's a freelance technical and science writer, hoping to escape the commute. Much of her work is based in London and she's looking for local business to expand her portfolio: articles, reports, jargon-free summaries of technical documents and web-copy, clear corporate or employee communications, etc. She has specific experience in science, medecine, game and web development, and would be available on a project- or part-time basis. Special rates for Brighton businesses that can spare her a train journey ;)</p>
