<p>After a quietish summer, I'm on the move in the next month or so.</p>

<ul>
<li> In a couple of weeks time, on 14th August, I'm giving a talk at the <a href="http://fivepoundapp.com/">&pound;5 apps event</a> about the gritty realities of setting up a software company;
<li> I'll be stepping in for <a href="http://www.eventyr.co.uk/">Joh</a> and hosting the <a href="http://codingdojo.futureplatforms.com/">Coding Dojo</a> on 22nd August, at Future Platforms' <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/fp/contact_us/">offices</a> in Brighton.
<li> Then I'm skipping across the pond with a trusty <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/360453540/">band of pals</a> to <a href="http://www.burningman.com/">Black Rock City</a>. Can you tell how excited I am about that? ;)
<li> We get back from the US just in time for <a href="http://2007.dconstruct.org/">dConstruct 2007</a>, which is looking absolutely fantastic;
<li> <a href="http://www.swedishbeers.blogspot.com/">Swedish Beers</a> follows on the 12th September. FP will be shouting loud about something then too :)
<li> On 18th September, I'll be panelling at <a href="http://www.m-trends.org/2007/07/informa-mobile-web-20-conference.html">Mobile Web 2.0</a> on the subject of "defragmentation";
<li> 25 - 29 September, I'm in Amsterdam for <a href="http://www.comeoutandplay.org/">Come Out And Play</a> and <a href="http://www.picnicnetwork.org/">PICNIC07</a>
<li> 14th October, it's the <a href="http://www.future-of-mobile.com/">Future of Mobile conference</a>, where I have the pleasure of speaking about mobile user experiences with <a href="http://www.pmn.co.uk/">Marek Pawlowski</a> :)
</ul>

<p>So a busy couple of months... and closer to home, we have the lovely <a href="http://www.loopbrighton.com/">Loop Festival</a> arriving in Brighton on the 18th and 19th August. And rumours of an interesting name in the Aikido world who might be paying us a visit in September - I'll post more here when I can. <br />
