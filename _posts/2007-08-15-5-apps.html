<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/1125084698/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1344/1125084698_d008b2bfb5_m.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" width="240" height="180" alt="&pound;5 apps audience" /></a>So I did the <a href="http://fivepoundapp.com/">&pound;5 apps</a> talk last night. Apart from some really annoying technical difficulties (the projector output of my laptop seems to be permanently blue), only alleviated when Andy leapt to the rescue, it seemed to go OK. I managed to blather on for over an hour even after cutting out a few slides at the last minute and glossing over some things I planned to go more in-depth on.</p>

<p>Sanitised slides are available <a href="http://tomhume.typepad.com/5apps.pdf">here</a>, if that's what you fancy. Cheers to <a href="http://ianozsvald.com/">Ian</a> for organising a fun night :)<br />
