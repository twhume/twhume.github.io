<p>Starts out with a bizarre list of the least successful Web 2.0 communities. Promoting his new book, "Digital Korea":</p>

<p>Every Korean home will have a home robot in 10 years. Korea has highest speed, lowest cost broadband in the world. In Korea broadband exceeds per capita - there's more broadband than people. 75% of cellphones in Korea are 3G. The majority of internet access in Korea is already mobile - the car is seen as the next place for the net to reach.</p>

<p>Tomi's gone a bit madder since I last saw him talk....</p>

<p>In India operators have rolled out a "background noise" service for use during calls.</p>

<p>Today in Japan 44% of all cellphone users actively click on advertising they receive via mobile.</p>

<p>Cameraphones designed for the under-10s sold by KDDI.</p>

<p>Think beyond screen size and keypad issue: "why can't the mobile phone read my mind?"</p>

<p>1/3 of students in Korea send 100+ text messages every day. This enables "near-telepathic connectivity". SMS is used to share secrets privately between friends, even when they're within speaking range.</p>

<p>30k business brands in South Korea are on Cyworld. 500k items of content for sale,</p>

<p>Kart Rider in Korea, making all its money from gifts and personalisation. Has professional players, is free-to-play. 25% of all Koreans have driven it.</p>

<p>Ends with a sales pitch for his books. Bit rude considering he's running 25 minutes over. Finishes with 3 thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>"User-generated content is not just rubbish: it can be high-quality content"
<li>"All major brands will be in the mobile web 2.0 space"
<li>"We don't need subscriptions or advertising to monitise mobile web 2.0; we can do this by customisation, gifts and so forth"
</ul>
