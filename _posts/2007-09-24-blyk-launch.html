<p>Blyk are <a href="http://www.mobile-ent.biz/news/28987/Blyk-goes-live-in-UK">launching</a> at last: "<i>The company is offering customers 43 minutes of voice and 217 texts a month for free as long as they opt in to receive up to six ads to their phone a day.</i>"</p>

<p>Good to see that they've lined up a reasonable set of advertisers, but the offer to consumers seems bizarre (43 minutes? 217 texts???) and possibly a little low, given the volume of advertising you receive in exchange for this. I'd also have a concern about the value of such a price-sensitive, fickle audience for advertisers, but hey what do I know?</p>

<p>Interesting to see that they're SIM free though. And I get a little tickled by their refusal to service customers over the age of 24 :)</p>
