<p>[Disclaimer: this post is about some work my company did. So you can't expect anything unbiased in here ;)]</p>

<p>So... one big thing I didn't get to write about last week was <a href="http://www.trutap.com/">Trutap</a> going into beta <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/17/techcrunch-40-session-2-mobile-communications/">at the TechCrunch conference</a> in the US. We've been working on the product all year; a lot of sweat's gone into it (and there's more on the way), so it's good to be able to talk publicly (ish) about it now.</p>

The eponymously named <a href="http://www.trutap.com/weblog/2007/09/18/press-release/">product</a> is designed for 18-24 year olds: the generation whose social life is half-lived online, and who don't currently have a way of taking all that digital stuff with them.  It's a feature-packed beast: a Java application ported to a wide range of handsets (which we're adding to over time) that pulls together instant messaging, blogging, management of contacts and its own messaging infrastructure into a coherent whole. Working closely with a team at Trutap (Ne&eacute; Hotxt), we designed the product from an interaction and visual perspective and built the on-phone client; in parallel with this a team of code ninjas at Trutap built the back-end and did all the heavy infrastructure work.

<p>Scale-wise it's the largest thing we've ever built, along almost every axis: time, team size, complexity, capability, and application size. Like everything we do in J2ME, the product is built on a foundation our <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/fp/products/cactus/">Cactus</a> platform provides for rapid mobile development, and the dev team have pushed it further than ever before: Trutap has an almost Flash-like in appearance (particularly some of the private builds we have which contain a few additional tweaks). We've done a lot of hard work on communications, optimisation and storage too - not all of which is immediately visible, or launched yet. If I can get permission I might write a post detailing some of the ways we've squeezed this into contemporary handsets, or about the development process: lots of lessons learned there across the board, but all behind the obligatory NDA.</p>

<p>And experience-wise it's slick; my favourite part is the in-built IM client which is  gorgeous, dirt simple, and lets you handle simultaneous chats across all your different IM accounts (Yahoo!, MSN, Jabber and ICQ - with more to follow)... and nicest of all you can do this whilst updating your blog, managing your contacts, or messaging.</p>

<p>The product isn't finished yet: we've a busy month ahead getting ready for a full UK launch, and even after then we've a roadmap for further development. But a big "yay!" to the team at <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">Future Platforms</a> (Miss Lozdan and Messrs Hopper, Franglen, Skinner, Ribot, and Falletti: that's you) who've made this possible, and are carrying on the good work :)</p>

<p>(If you're interested in getting onto the pre-launch beta, drop me an email and I'll let you know a super secret beta code you can use. Or check out the <a href="http://www.trutap.com/abouttrutap">demos</a> online if you like.)</p>
