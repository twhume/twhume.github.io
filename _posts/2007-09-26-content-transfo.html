<p>Just spotted <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-bpwg-ct/2007Sep/0029.html">this</a> from a Novarra chap (Novarra being the guys behind the ire-generating Vodafone content transformation proxy): "<i>A well-designed content transformation server can do a better job of following the mobile best practices than a human author, especially when taking into account the capabilities of the many different mobile devices.  The result will be a more consistent, uniform experience.</i>"</p>

<p>I'd completely disagree; I don't understand how an automated product can produce a better experience than one designed by someone taking into account the context of use, unique characteristics of mobile, and so forth. I *can* see how an automated proxy might be more rigid in defining its markup, but most of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp/">W3C mobile web best practice recommendations</a> are nothing to do with markup, and everything to do with common sense: something very difficult to codify into cold machine logic.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mobileOK-basic10-tests/">MobileOK tests</a> are a different matter (much more focused around markup and easier to automate), but a mobile service that complies with MobileOK without BPG is both technically perfect and practically useless.</p>
