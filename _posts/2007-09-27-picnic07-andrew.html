<p><b>PICNIC07: Andrew Keen, author of Cult of the Amateur</b></p>

<p>This is in response to David Weinberger's earlier talk.</p>

<p>Andrew: David is a philosopher and marketer; his talk was a philosopher selling the web in a seductive way. I don't agree with a lot of what he said. The issue we disagree with on complexity; he says "we want more complexity; complexity is interesting".</p>

<p>He's mixing media with the world; what he wants is for media to reflect the world, but I don't think it should. Media shouldn't trivialise the world, but communicate it in a way we all understand; the Internet today doesn't do this, it creates complexity and confusion. The job of gatekeepers in traditional media is to simplify things. Do you think media should reflect the world?</p>

<p>Talent is scarce, as are resources. Good journalists have both the ability to do their job, and the ability to devote their time to it. Amateurs don't have this.</p>

<p>[...trailed into an interesting, but difficult-to-blog, argument...]</p>
