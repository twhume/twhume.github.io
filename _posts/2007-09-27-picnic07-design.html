<p><b>PICNIC07: Designing Killer Experiences, Peter Frankfurt</b></p>

<p>Every company in entertainment wants to be Pixar when they grow up. Started off with title sequence for Seven, attracted clients and young designers. Putting something onto a cinema screen is quite attractive for these folks :)</p>

<p>Started working on Transformers 1+ year before the film came out. Teaser created with no footage of the film. Michael Bay saw it: "Fucking cool". Shows different versions of the trailer for different markets, with logotype transforming into various scripts. Doing 20+ versions was financially pretty good for a graphics company ;)</p>

<p>Amusing trailer for Spike TV - like 24hrs of Bravo TV squeezed into 15 seconds with volume and contrast up to maximum.</p>

<p>Very visual presentation, difficult to get notes done...</p>

<p>Building virtual worlds is about taking something familiar and doing something to it that upsets, delights, whatever - just gets your attention.</p>

<p>Talks about World Trade Centre redesign: the original proposals were deeply unpopular so it was put out to the design community. Small agencies worldwide got together. "We literally had to create a world in lower Manhattan in 6 weeks". Decided to treat the presentation and process of the design as a film-making process: storyboarding informed a lot of the design, and a film was created as part of the presentation.</p>
