<p><B>PICNIC07: Future Technology Trends, Nikolaj Nyholm</B></p>

<p>This is an introduction to work at <a href="http://www.polarrose.com/">Polar Rose</a>, inspired by growth of photo sharing sites online. Flickr doubles in size every 8 months - how do we manage this data?</p>

<p>Polar Rose does facial recognition. Traditionally this needed a very controlled environment. Extracts 3D data from 2D image and computes lighting sources (much like the PhotoSynth guys <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2007/09/picnic07-blaise.html">yesterday</a>, I'm guessing). There's a lot of data in faces: we can work out whether a face is male or female quite accurately.</p>

<p>It's a plugin for Firefox, highlighting faces and asking them to be recognised. During the beta phase they're gathering face data. Getting into indexing video too.</p>
