<p><b>PICNIC07: Future Technology Trends, Alexander Straub</b></p>

<p><a href="http://www.pixsta.com/">Pixsta</a>: interesting way of looking at images without looking at images themselves: looking at similarities in and closeness between images, and building web applications around these.</p>

<p>Shows demo of shopping site showing handbags similar to the bag you're currently looking at - in an interestingly messy display. Quite pretty actually, a nice way to browse items. A very quick way for human beings to browser 4-500 products in a short time, using the brain for what it's best at - recognising images, finding similarities and matching patterns. Simple but neat. Cool for something like <A href="http://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a>.</p>

<p>No tagging behind the shopping demo: it's all done via the image data itself.</p>
