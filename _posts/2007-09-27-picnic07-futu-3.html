<p><b>PICNIC07: Future Technology Trends, Arnold Smeulders</b></p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.multimedian.nl/en/home.php">MultimediaN</a>. Dreadful demo of 3D museum based on semantic web, with extremely rousing music. Not quite sure what it does, mind.</p>

<p>Second search engine: crawls LiveJournal looking for moods (a bit like <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2007/09/picnic07-jonath.html">We Feel Fine</a> then).</p>

<p>Third one: P2P video exchange search engine. "Windows for your TV screen". Connects media centres in living rooms to provide "enormous computing power" to do video analysis.</p>

<p>Fourth one: video browsing product.</p>

<p>Have to say, in the limited time here I didn't really get much of a feel for any of these products.<br />
