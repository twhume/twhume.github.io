<p><b>PICNIC07: Minimally Invasive Education through Social Play, Dr. Sugata Mitra</b></p>

<p>I've been looking forward to this one :) So obviously my battery is running low :(</p>

<p>Later: easily the best talk so far. Wonderfully simple, uplifting and socially important. Find out anything you can about <a href="http://www.picnicnetwork.org/artefact-7101-en.html">this</a> and <a href="http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/india/thestory.html">the guy behind it</a>. Thanks to Ribot Minimus for a link to his <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=817865730995933068&hl=en">presentation at LIFT07</a> (which I missed).</p>
