<p><b>PICNIC07: Some thoughts on creating worlds, Michael Johnson</b></p>

<p>Talking about making a movie at Pixar. 3 steps:</p>

<ol>
<li> Creating an interesting world with self-consistent rules;
<li> Designing engaging characters that exist in that world;
<li> Tell a compelling story with those characters in that world (the hard part, where flaws are exposed);
</ol>

<p>All underpinned by research. e.g. in a Bugs Life, they put cameras at ground level and noticed that everything seemed translucent - so used that in the film. Shows 2 videos of fish in water side-by-side: one film, the other animation based on film: indistinguishable.</p>

<p>For Ratatouille they spent a lot of time running round Paris in the Autumn, looking at live action, etc. Also spent time looking at the details of food porn photography.</p>

<p>Again, Edna from the Incredibles: building up of the character through 2D and 3D design. <br />
