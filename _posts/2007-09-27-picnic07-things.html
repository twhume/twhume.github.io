<p><b>PICNIC07: Things I have learned in my life so far, Stefan Sagmeister</b></p>

<p>Talks on work for a logo for a new building. Spent weeks trying to avoid using the building itself, then realised the building itself was the logo. Isolated the building, flipped it around, and took 6 different views of it for 6 logos. Colour scheme taken from any image pumped into a logo maker programme. Summary of it <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/the_17_sides_of_a_cultural_ide.php">here</a>.</p>

<p>Socially responsible design: an organisation of 500 American businessmen <a href="http://www.sensiblepriorities.org/">got together</a> to petition the government to reduce military spending by 15% and spend the savings on education. The group has marketing know-how and money; they ran full-page ads, but for the $75k this cost (in the NYT) they could build <A href="http://www.sensiblepriorities.org/topsy.php">vehicles</a>, running around the US looking good on TV so local news picks up on them - generating more publicity than a NYT advert does.</p>

<p>For a lighting company, the brief was "show the power of light". Did a raise imprint with various shadows etc playing off it, with different colours.</p>

One of these was "unavailability creates desire": when they reopened they got loads of work, with better briefs. In his client-free year he makes a list of thoughts, e.g. "everything I do always comes back to me". He was surprised that he got a load of difficult feedback from ads he rang along these lines. Another: "trying to look good limits my life". Another: "Everybody thinks they are right". Clients were now coming to him asking for another sentence to use for their campaigns.</p>

<p>"Starting a charity is surprisingly easy": written using microscopic photography.</p>

<p>"Being not truthful works against me": a spiderweb projected onto a white wall which reacts to passers-by, all created using an iMac and custom software.</p>

<p>"Keeping a diary supports my personal development". As time went past, clients became free-er and free-er in their briefs.</p>

<p>"Money does not make me happy": lettering raised in what look like piles of flour or sugar. The printer lost some of the original artwork and reproduced it, changing the meaning. The piece was rerun by a casino (!).</p>

<p>From 0 - 35,000 euros/year money makes a significant difference to peoples lives. Above this quantity, it makes no difference at all: your level of comfort remains the same.</p>

<p>"Having guts always works out for me".</p>
