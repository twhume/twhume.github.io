<p>Some challenges of ubicomp:</p>

<ol>
<li> Invisibility: things may not be immediately apparent and will need signposting.
<li> Heterogenity: things need to work together seamlessly.
<li> Ownership: users of infrastructure don't own it.
<li> Cultural bias: designers add their own bias to designs.
<li> Decay: what do we do with old or decommissioned sensors?
</ol>

<p>One response to these challenges is playfulness:</p>

<ol>
<li> Seamfulness: deliberately exposing the existence of ubicomp sensors, say - e.g. by exposing the range of CCTV cameras to ensure people know where they're being watched.
<li> Ambiguity to draw attention or provoke questions about how people experience the environment;
<li> Learning from accidents, not just positive perspectives. Better can be worse sometimes.
</ol>

<p>Conclusion:</p>

<ol>
<li> Technological messiness shouldn't be ignored
<li> Little works has been done on this
<li> We should understand how malfunctions can be communicated
</ol>
