<p><b>PICNIC07: The City Is Here For You To Use, Adam Greenfield</b></p>

<p>Not so much about play, more about cities. Comes from user experience background of developing large-scale web sites. Cares about human experience, not devices.</p>

<p>"How I learned to be an urbanist": Jane Jacobs, Christopher Alexander, Bernard Rudofsky</p>

<p>They worried about cars, traffic, overplanning... we've killed the street without that (though not in Amsterdam where lots of this hasn't happened, as in Seoul).</p>

<p>"The repeating module of doom": Manhattan streets look like a background of a video-game. Walking 10 blocks along the street, you get into a cycle of the same large brand franchises/chains repeating themselves.</p>

<p>Cities keep you deliberately confounded in order to keep you there and spending money. Las Vegas and malls are examples of this: a persistent sense of delocation. </p>

<p>And the environment is actively being made hostile: stealthy, slippery, crusty, prickly and jittery. e.g. postboxes covered with spikes to stop people sitting on it; Tokyo park benches designed to be uncomfortable to sit on, impossible to sleep on, etc.</p>

<p>Mobile devices get us withdrawing from society, instead of engaging with it.</p>

<p>BUT...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/1453811058/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1234/1453811058_a41537913c_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Adam Greenfield" align="right" hspace="10" /></a>Nostalgia is for suckers. How can we rediscover what it takes to make cities, again? Ubicomp is the answer! Informatic systems embedded into the environment, communicating wirelessly, imperceptible, and post-GUI.</p>

<p>To ambient informatics, and beyond! Information processing at different scales: body, street, etc. Nike+, RFID, etc. Urban information processing. Shinjuku lamp post which reacts to RFID contact with helpful information: infrastructure that has more agency than it used to. All this giving rise to a new model of interaction: e.g. <a href="http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/en/index.jsp">Octopus</a> in Hong Kong, where the entire transaction between card and reader happens in a dance choreographed by women (in particular) swinging their bags over the reader as they go through. A complex set of protocol exchanges turned into a dance.</p>

<p>How will the positive side of this play out?</p>

<p>One natural thing we do with information is visualising it. e.g. Stamen Designs' <a href="http://cabspotting.org/">cabspotting</a>; Paris visualised by wi-fi hot spots; and we can use these visualisations to pipe information back to people inside these places. e.g. maps of street crime made available to mobile devices. </p>

<p>(What are the second-order effects of a closed feedback loop like this - I avoid an area because they are areas I should avoid, so less people go there, so there's less scrutiny...)</p>

<p>Some of these inputs regulate the shape of buildings - e.g. <a href="http://www.inhabitat.com/2007/06/21/carbon-dioxide-sensing-living-glass/">living glass</a>, with sensors that respond to CO2 levels in the room and opens windows to let in oxygen automatically; the incredible <a href="http://www.arcspace.com/architects/DillerScofidio/blur_building/">Blur Building</a>; the <a href="http://beverlytang.com/reblog/archives/000166.html">carbon tower</a>, with active lateral balancing based on inhabitants, weather and seismic conditions.</p>

<p>Also: addressable/scriptable objects, screens, surfaces: RFID, augmented reality, <A href="http://www.semacode.org/">semacode</a>/<a href="http://www.semapedia.org/">semapedia</a>.</p>

<p>Upshot: a city that responds to its residents and other users (e.g. weather) in real time. "The city is the platform".</p>

<p>These systems will be used to reinscribe class boundaries.</p>

<p>The downside: overlegibility, everything is explicit and there's no room for ambiguity or plausible deniability. Everything is stated, announced, and made social: maybe we don't want our friends to know where we are all the time. Emergent behaviour: we'll have to accept the cost of this.</p>

<p>The upside: more efficient use of natural resources and infrastructure. e.g. letting people how long they have to cross the road before the lights change, saves lives!</p>

<p>New ways to use the city based on these devices. e.g. Nike+ lets Adam run in NY and compete against friends running in London and SF.</p>

<p>So what (whimsically) could this look like, in Amsterdam?</p>

<ol>
<li> Coffeeshopper: using sensor networks in coffee shops to break down potency of waste products, to identify coffee shops by strength of product;
<li> Red Light 2.0: service providers wearing an anklet and the window is a touch display exposing charges, language spoken, etc.
<li> WhiteBike (beta): free, LBS-tracked bicycles deposited around the city at random. At the end of the day a programme specifies optimal route for pickup, taken by a truck.
</ol>

<p>"Systems are for cities, and cities are for people"<br />
