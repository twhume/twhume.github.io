<p>Does "participatory sensory mapping": what do you do with this data you can gather, how do you turn it into a political proposition? What are the tools we can use to rethink the space?</p>

<p>He <a href="http://www.softhook.com/sensory.htm">blindfolds children</a> and has them led along by someone else, using other senses (smell, etc.) for local area. Produces a sensory deprivation map, a set of experiences geolocated: beautiful. 50% of categorisations are negative, 22% neutral, 28% positive.</p>

<p>Turns this into getting kids involved with local politics: there's a road in front of the school full of traffic and smells.</p>

<p>Next project: lie detector + GPS unit, to create <a href="http://www.emotionmap.net/">emotion maps</a>. Tends to do these in areas of regeneration - e.g. <a href="http://stockport.emotionmap.net/">Stockport</a>. PDAs are good, but physical paper maps are nice because you can stand around them: they talk in a language people can understand.</p>

<p>Really really nice looking stuff :)</p>
