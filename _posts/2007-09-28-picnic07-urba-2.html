<p>Artist working since 1991, making a range of artworks particularly game-based projects.</p>

<p>Shows "Can you see me now": using real-world runners controlled by players at laptops, to avoid being caught by virtual-world runners. Avatars communicate with their players by voice; players need to guide them to collect photos, using the cityscape as a field of play.</p>

<p>"Uncle Roy Is All Around You": exploring a meaningful connection between the fabric of the city and game play, using small city areas and tightly authored content.</p>

<p>These games are challenging to build and don't scale: this is the theme from a few of the speakers this morning. They need to learn about LocoMatrix :)</p>

<p>"Rider Spoke" in collaboration with Mixed Reality Lab of Nottingham Uni, launching October. </p>

<p>Piss, battery low so switching off until I find power. Which means no blogging of the rest of this or Mr Cerveny's talk... (as if mere written word can pretend to contain him...)</p>
