<p><b>PICNIC07: Urban Playgrounds, Federico Casalegno, MIT</b></p>

<p>Exploring how people, info and tech evolve. Presenting 2 projects.</p>

<ol>
<li> <a href="http://mobile.mit.edu/component/option,com_deeppockets/task,catShow/id,31/Itemid,81//">The electronic lens</a>, with the govt of Catalunya: how can we rethink how citizens and institutions communicate, using mobile devices? Retrieve info from local places using physical bookmarks etc. Looks like a fairly standard tag-real-world thingy;
<li> What is the <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2007/05/06/bus_20/">bus stop of the future</a>? A landmark customised by UGC apparently, with a screen owned by the transportation agency for braodcasting information. At the back was a 6m x 2m wall with LEDs. The metaphor: the more communication happens within the bus stop, the more activity there is in the garden. Quite cute.
