<p>I'm delighted to reveal that we've persuaded <a href="http://bryanrieger.blogspot.com/">Bryan Rieger</a> to join <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">Future Platforms</a> full-time as our Senior Designer. If you keep up with mobile blogs (or in particular, mobile Flash), you'll have come across Bryan: he's been doing some fantastic stuff in this area <a href="http://www.yiibu.com/">over the last few years</a>, and we can't wait to get working with him :)</p>
