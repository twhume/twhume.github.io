<p>Jeremy's <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1354">kicked off a shitstorm on Flickr</a>: "<i>In a nutshell, I&rsquo;m getting penalised for having search-engine friendly pages. I, along with some other people on that thread, have tried to explain that Adactio Elsewhere is just one example of public Flickr data appearing beyond the bounds of Flickr&rsquo;s domain&mdash;an issue tangentially relatred to intellectual property rights.</i>"</p>

<p>This really reminds me of David Weinbergers <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2007/09/picnic07-everyt.html">comments at Picnic about unowned order</a>: in the digital world, there's no incremental cost to putting things in more than one (virtual) location, and it's possible for the organisation of data to be separate from the data itself; we can all own different perspectives onto the same data which the owner of the data isn't privy to.</p>

<p>And yeah, Mr Keith is spot-on that this is a cultural, not technical issue. I suspect that even having spent the last 18 years online I'm too old to really "get this" in my bones, and that the current wave of teenagers and young adults are the first people who might internalise this. /me thinks about record companies selling MP3s as though they were physical product...</p>
