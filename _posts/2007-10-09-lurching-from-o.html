On the train to London yesterday, I noticed myself doing one of those clinging-to-old media things.

I have a signature on my email - yer standard contact details, email, mobile number, etc. This I add automatically to all emails I send.

But I type my name at the foot of emails. Why? Because it feels like I'm signing the email that way, though obviously it'd be way more efficient to have this automatically added... but I don't do this because it'd feel "fake". I'm such a fool I like signing my emails with QWERTY because I instinctively and irrationally think it gives them a personal touch...
