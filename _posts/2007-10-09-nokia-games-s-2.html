<strong>Nokia Games Summit 2007: SNAP Mobile, Markus Huttunen</strong>

"Nothing new here - I'm going to press F5 on what's going on in the mobile gaming space"

What's the promise of connectivity in mobile gaming? People love connectivity in play across all sorts of electronic and real-world gaming. XBox Live is now the key differentiator between XBox and Wii/Playstation, but it took them 4/5 years to get there.

Casual gaming: Pogo has 170k players online at once, at night. It gets more eyeball-hours (the new currency of attention) than Desperate Housewives, etc.

Connected games get better shelf space, they're bought more, get played longer, and are differentiated from the mass of games out there.

Operators get more data revenues from data customers, upsell data to voice customers, showcases fancy data networks, and doesn't hurt to add to the overall offering to customers. Given the move to flat-rate and a lack of supporting data for the last 3 I'm not sure how great this sell is...?

ROI for this is unbalanced: technical fragmentation, high testing costs, immature technology vs limited distribution, difficult to deploy globally (nod to operator gateway problems) and no premium for connectivity.

Halo got 1m players online in one day. If Nokia ship 1m connected phones/day and they have a connected snake (say) game onto it... how will that scale? Getting this working with such huge numbers is a challenge.

The dominant distribution channels in mobile games (operators) aren't taking risk and giving premium placement to connected games. 

Nokia have purchased and put in place a global infrastructure for serving this stuff.
