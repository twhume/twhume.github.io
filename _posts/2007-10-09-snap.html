Interesting titbit from a talk by Anton Gauffin of GameLion: <a href="http://snapmobile.nokia.com/core/en/index.html">SNAP</a> games can be ported to handsets from non-Nokia manufacturers. There's no Nokia-specific stuff in there (though I'd like to know if this is something that will continue into the future).

Update: just asked, and yep, it's a standard that's going to be kept across handsets from different manufacturers.
