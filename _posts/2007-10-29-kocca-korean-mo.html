<strong>Kocca Korean Mobile Content Forum: Think Big - what works on mobile</strong>

Mitch Lazar, VP biz dev, Yahoo Europe

Shows a promotional video for Yahoo: lots of techno and phone screens (hmm: inverse relationship between BPM of soundtrack and superficial user experience of product?).

"We are at an amazing inflection point": devices, pricing schemes and network speed. The online ad business took off in 88/89 - we're about 10 years behind the fixed internet and 2008/9 will be the big years for mobile ads. "Lots of eyeballs".

People are online in different ways: rise of social networking. Online ad spend is growing in its own right to a small extent, but most growth is due to offline spending moving online. As agencies get comfortable spending money online, they'll get more comfortable spending on mobile.

Why mobile advertising?

<ol>
<li> Reach (bit of a "because it's there" argument: there are lots of toothbrushes, but this doesn't make them a great ad medium);
<li> Core audience of 16-24s being strong mobile users; as these guys age, we'll see their habits spread: multi-tasking through different media, increasing comfort with pull rather than push media, etc.
</ol>

Communication is evolving, and mobile is at the heart of these changes. Older media businesses need to change: PC content doesn't always work well on mobile; mobile applications so far have just been extensions of PC experiences (e.g. Yahoo! oneSearch: millions of links aren't what you want on mobile). Interestingly, the top list of results in an example Mitch gives has web sites quite a way down the list: this isn't a search of online content as much as it is a directory search. Implication: web sites aren't what you want on the move (or at least, most of them aren't your top priority).

Rule 2: keep it simple. Yahoo! Go "puts the internet in your pocket" (lots of people seem to be claiming this at the moment). In my experience, Go is really monolithic: when I tried it (yonks back, admittedly), I found it a little frightening to overlay a whole heap of Yahoo! services (most of which I didn't use) onto my handset.

Rule 3: make money. Global figures from 2006: $871m mobile advertising, $24b internet advertising, $450b all advertising. Hmm, so mobile is currently <0.2% ad spend, internet 5.3%.

"No media survives without advertising": except public broadcasting.

Very ad-driven, understandably given that's how Yahoo! exist.

"Mobile is differenet, keep it simple, make money": all true, all realistic, but none particularly insightful.
