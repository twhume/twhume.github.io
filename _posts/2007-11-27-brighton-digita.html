<p>So, another <a href="http://www.brightondigitalfestival.co.uk/">Brighton Digital Festival</a> has been and gone. I made it out for three events during the month of pixelly stuff that Wired Sussex curated, and whilst I'm definitely biased about one of them, all were fun.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/2039406169/" title="Dolphin race by twhume, on Flickr"><img width="240" hspace="10" height="180" border="0" align="right" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2027/2039406169_e14604c2e8_m.jpg" alt="Dolphin race" /></a>First up was the <a href="http://brightonwebawards.co.uk/">Brighton Web Awards</a>, which has really grown up since its Virtual Festival roots. I've missed the last couple of these and subsequently had no idea it was so proper'n'glitzy - they had a red carpet and everything. Tara from <a href="http://www.wiredsussex.com/">Wired Sussex</a> and Mark of <a href="http://www.scip.org/">SCIP</a> fame ably compered (&quot;dining out&quot; indeed, Mark!), I spotted folks from most of the Brighton scene lurking around (and even argued drunkenly with a few of them). A personal high point was <a href="http://wellieswithwings.blogspot.com/">Soph</a>'s winning the Best Personal Site category, and going on to win the audience vote for Best of Show... so in keeping with the spirit of text voting scandals this year, <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">FP</a> provided the mechanic for the audience vote: a virtual dolphin race powered by SMS messages, and brought to life through the awesome talent of <a href="http://bryanrieger.blogspot.com/">Mr Rieger</a>.
</p>

<p>Later I think we had a crowd of people back to Rosehill. Things become blurry around then, I think we dissolved the memories in vodka.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/2040293061/" title="Wires, temperature sensors and RFID fun by twhume, on Flickr"><img width="240" hspace="10" height="180" border="0" align="left" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2357/2040293061_3b244d5487_m.jpg" alt="Wires, temperature sensors and RFID fun" /></a>Much more sober and twice as random was <a href="http://www.farmhackday.com/">Hack Day</a>, put together by Paul Silver and held at the Brighthelmstone Centre. For this we had a team of coding dojo veterans and devoted ourselves to one of the most obscure combinations of technology I've ever been involved with: a text adventure game written for the day hooked up to a web server, a temperator sensor and RFID reader. Somehow we managed to balance a plot on top of all this and got the various bits of tech (<a href="http://www.inform-fiction.org/I7/Inform%207.html">Inform 7</a>, web server, <a href="http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/">SFTP server</a>, <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/Robot.html">Java Robot classes</a>, RFID reader, USB temperature sensor, a load of custom Java serial code and probably some other bits I've forgotten about) working towards a more-or-less-coherent goal... all run over 3-4 hours, obviously in an Agile fashion :)</p>

<p>And on the subject of Agile... <a href="http://www.bluejoh.com/">Joh</a> and I gave a talk about it at <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/309890/">Skillswap</a> last week. She covered off the thinking underlying agile, its history and an overview of why it all works, I blathered on about our experiences adopting it, messing it up, learning from our mistakes and actually starting to do useful stuff with it over the last 4-5 years at FP. I hope it made sense to anyone there; it'll be interesting to do another event like this in a few months when we're a bit further into Scrum (tomorrow is the end of our first 2-week sprint)...</p>

<p>All great fun!</p>
