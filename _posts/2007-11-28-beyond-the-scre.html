<p>Last minute Hume booking! I'll be talking at <a href="http://www.use8.net/">Beyond The Screen</a> this Friday, around the corner from FPHQ. I'll be doing a short 15-minute skit with Richard Vahrman from LocoMatrix, on some of the real-world interface difficulties we found and solved when FP were building a GPS gaming platform. There's an Upcoming page for the event <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/316999/">here.</a></p>
