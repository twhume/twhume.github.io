<p>I dashed back from class last night (courtesy of a lift from Ms Trchalik) and rushed over to the <a href="http://www.komedia.co.uk">Komedia</a> to catch the last two-thirds of Poets vs MCs with <a href="http://www.orbific.com/">James</a>, <a href="http://www.wellieswithwings.org/">Soph</a> and Ruth. I'd expected it to be a fairly quiet affair (having been to a few low-key Brighton poetry events which tended to max out at around 20 people), and was amazed at how busy the place was. The Komedia was unusually packed out - with a strange crowd, split down the middle with everyone identifiable as a support of one group or the other.</p>

<p>The highlight for me was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FtlmEzC5IU">Spliff Richard</a> - I'm not sure why he wasn't considered an MC, coming as he did from the slam poet side of the fence and out-rapping quite a few of the rappers - with Robin and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shinymcshine/">Chris Parkinson</a> coming a close second. On the MC side, Dr Syntax really stood out too :)</p>
