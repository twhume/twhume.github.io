<p>I'm Bluetoothing some files from my phone to my laptop. My phone is sitting on the desk to the right of my laptop. I just caught myself absentmindedly moving the "Bluetooth transfer" window over to the right-hand side of my screen, so it would be nearer to my phone and help the photos transfer across quicker...</p>

<p>It's nice to see instinctual stuff intrude on decades of intellectual conditioning sometimes :)</p>
