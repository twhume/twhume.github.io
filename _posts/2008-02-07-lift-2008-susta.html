<p>Bill Thompson and Philippa Martin-King talking about sustainability.</p>

<p>BT: It's not about carbon load, it's about availability of voltage differences. There's a link between electricity and carbon, but carbon is not the problem... ICT systems were designed in a time before environmental issues, they're not efficient... We need to take small steps to improve our efficiency so we can justifiably approach governments and corporations and ask them to change.</p>

<p>PMK: It's today's youth who will be dealing with the problem.</p>

<p><<b>Tom Taylor on using social softwar to encourage sustainable behaviour</b>:</p>

<p>It's clear that our behaviours are unsustainable. 88% of people are concerned, most have problems finding things that they can do to help beyond recycling.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dothegreenthing.com/">www.dothegreenthing.com</a> - a social site around setting up monthly actions in which to participate. Badges of green actions individuals have carried out. It's a hook: doing something easy gets you into the site, which then moves you on to do harder things. (<i>Very reminiscent of another startup we've been talking to recently.</i>)</p>

<p>Namechecks Nike+, Wattson, iPhone interface for monitoring electricity usage in your house (using Bluetooth plug sockets).</p>

<p>"<i>It needs to be positive, fun and easy</i>".</p>

<p>Next, <b>Guy Pignolet from Sunsat Energy Council on solar energy capture</b>.</p>

<p>We have plenty of energy coming to us from the sun. Maybe we need not more energy, but better energy - getting it in a more controlled way: from storms, waves, etc. We don't just need energy, we need controlled energy.</p>

<p>Japanese project: SSPS by Mitsubishi transports energy capture by sunlight using satellites to the earth by microwave: generate solar power in orbit. All the science exists now.</p>

<p>"<i>We need a solar panel in space the size of Manhattan</i>". So these are expected to be operational 30-40 years from now.</p>

<p>Second part: hydrogen. Batteries are poor, we don't know how to store electrocity - it has to be used when it's produced. Most of the universe is hydrogen.</p>

<p>...oop, battery low... </p>
