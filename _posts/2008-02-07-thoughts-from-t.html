<p>Drawing out some interesting chunks of today:</p>

<ul>
<li> I think most presentations have referenced or been heavily based upon mobile, much more so than last year;
<li> The idea of community-supported teaching that Ewan McIntosh alluded to (there being only a single reviewer of classwork currently, the teacher), harked back to Sugatra Mitra's work having Indian children self-teach computer literacy;
<li> I'm wondering how social software should enable lies (or at least plausible deniability) and how sharing secrets might be used online as a starting point to build relationships;
<li> Rafi of Violet's comment that "<i>Fun and interpersonal communication are as powerful propositions as usefulness</i>". I sooo need to get my RFID on;
<li> The developing world as an audience for mobile, strangely enough tying into a presentation we had from a client regaring a product we'd built recently;
<li> Paul Dourish on ethnography was fascinating, I'm desperately trying to relate it to something I could practically *do*...
</ul>
