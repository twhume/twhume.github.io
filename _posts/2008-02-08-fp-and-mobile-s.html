New Media Age did <a href="http://www.nma.co.uk/Articles/36788/Mobile+Social+Networking.html">a nice little piece on mobile social networking</a>, and I was chuffed to see that two of the top 10 to watch are clients of <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">Future Platforms</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flirtomatic.com/">Flirtomatic</a> are now the largest off-portal WAP destination in the UK; way back in 2004/05 we worked on the first version of their product. <a href="http://www.trutap.com/">Trutap</a> are a more recent client; we've worked with them since the end of 2006 to design and build their front-end application, and we're still working with them on some stuff I can't talk about just yet... but is looking really nice. If you're going to Mobile World Congress next week and bump into <a href="http://trutap.com/corporate">Carl or Dave</a>, hassle them nicely and they might show you :)</p>

<p>OK, consider my trumpet blown, that's enough :)<br />
