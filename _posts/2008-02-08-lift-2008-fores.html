<p><b>Scott Smith, Changeist</b></p>

<p>Reference models for technology adoption (e.g. The Chasm) are stale.</p>

<p>Need more human and social stuff to understand adoption.  Wants/needs/fears/goals vs trends/driving forces/events/black swans.</p>

<p>Every 20-30 years generations go through major shifts.</p>

<p>New trend: modal fluency: users go through seamless movement between different modes of interaction. (<i>Is this really a trend... I don't see DS owners taking their DS play to the Wii, or online. And it's one of those things that's been mooted for yonks now.</i>)</p>

<p>Apologies for poor notes, I'm flagging not blogging...<br />
