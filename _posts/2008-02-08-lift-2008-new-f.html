<p>Friday morning. Turned up late for a <b>Kevin Warwick lecture</b>, as tradition demands.</p>

<p>Icky demo video, very sensationalist stuff. Kevin talks about broadcasting electrical impulses from himself across the internet.</p>

<p>"<i>Tonight when you're bored, get some very thin wires and try to push them into your nervous system</i>"</p>

<p>25-30 minutes before an epileptic fit, signals in the brain occur which indicate the onset of epilepsy - so fitting sensors to the brain can have a definite medical benefit here.</p>

<p>Talks about cultured neural networks - biological tissue hooked up to simple robots.</p>

<p>Next, <b>Holm Friebe and Philip X from Zentral Intelligenz Agentur</b> on the topic work, its quality and its changing nature.</p>

<p>"Rules of working together professionally and still remaining friends": working in a laid-back manner using digital technology. They've been road-testing these concepts in their own company; this is an interim report. They've distilled them into 7 rules:</p>

<p>How do you integrate individuals with a strong sense of individualisation, who wouldn't fit into a normal business?</p>

<p>(<i>I'm starting to have my "we're special, not like other people" buttons pressed. A bit like people who capitalise the word "creative" and talk about "working spaces for creative people" - imagination fascism</i>)</p>

<p>Their business turns over 200k euros per year - so not exactly a commercial heavyweight, but living costs are low in Berlin.</p>

<p>Their name serves as an entrance filter - people who don't get it won't make good customers for them.</p>

<ol>
<li> Start with no offices; if you hang around at the same place all the time, you won't be able to stand each other;
<li> No employees, so no-one depends on the company materially;
<li> No fixed costs - they only spend 15 euros on servers a month; this keeps you independent of clients and incorruptible - you can always say no;
<li> No pitches;
<li> No exclusivity;
<li> No working hours;
<li> No bullshit;
</ol>

<p>All you need is "a good name, a web site and some business cards"</p>

<p>(<i>I would be pleasantly surprised if anyone made a commercially successful business out of this. For instance, I find colocation to be one of the best parts of working with someone - the random sparking of ideas you get by being around someone for the working day is where interesting stuff happens.</i>)</p>

<p>They've broken these rules already - they have offices. "But they're not meant to impress clients".</p>

<p>They've set up a co-working space based on the commercial model of a gym.</p>

<p>Rule 2: engage in client work and self-induced projects with equal committment. Sounds lovely and I would agree this is worthwhile: R&D seems important for technology or design-based businesses (and probably lots of others).</p>

<p>Rule 3: instant gratification, distribute profits immediately after a job is completed. People need to pay their rent (of course) but I'm not sure how that implies this. They keep 10% of profit for the company to accrue some play money for their own projects. They pay bills immediately.<br />
 <br />
Rule 4: Pluralism of methods: find technical solutions for social problems, use online tools wherever possible. I know some people really grok this, I love physical colocation myself. They wrote their own collaborative editing tools and voting mechanisms.</p>

<p>Rule 5: Fixed ideas. e.g. turning everything bad and annoying about Powerpoint into an on-stage format. They pulled 20 presentations off the net and got folks to get up and improvise presentations. Another project: direct feedback for poetry slam, letting callers leave feedback. The poets were wired up to a current and administered electric shocks when they received negative feedback.</p>

<p>Rule 6: Responsibilities without hierarchies. Each project has 1 person in charge, but it can be anybody. People play different roles within different projects. At the beginning of the year they have a retreat in the countryside, plan out upcoming projects and the year.</p>

<p>Rule 7: The Power of Procrastination. Don't try to be too efficient. Good ideas will adapt and catch on, even if you neglect them for a while.</p>

<p>Rule 7.5: No PR, if you do interesting stuff the press will come to you.</p>

<p>Next, <b>Mieke Gerritzen on different views on natural and visual culture</b>:</p>

<p>Mobile network masts are being disguised as trees, despite the additional cost of doing so. In Dubai they've just built islands in the shape of a world map. The  Netherlands keeps a country that's below sea level dry.</p>

<p>Nature becomes culture: every square metre of ground in the Netherlands is man-made ("God created the world, except for the Netherlands: the Dutch did that").</p>

<p>We have designer hypoallergenic cats on the market. Next year we can expect transgenic cats which will remain kitten-sized for their whole life.</p>

<p>Shows logo drawn on the wing of a butterfly.</p>

<p>We have a shortage of human organ donors. Shows artists impression of an organ printer.</p>

<p>The featherless chicken has been created in Tel Aviv. It's a more convenient and energy-efficient chicken to live in warm countries where feathered chickens have trouble and air conditioning is expensive.</p>

<p>Colouring plate for children showing the sheer volume of animals on a contemporary farm.</p>

<p>Edible packaging for apples. To help people get their 2 portions of fruit a day, they're growing bizarre double-apples. As buildings become more inspired by nature, nature is becoming more controlled by man.</p>

<p>Nature becomes culture, culture becomes nature.</p>

<p>Shows video about implants and the increasing use of them in medecine. Fictional story about metal implants growing after insertion - didn't we get this stuff out of our system with Tetsuo The Iron Man? Reasonably disturbing images of people and animals with metal growing out of them - wooooo.</p>

<p>Lots of assertions I don't get, like "science fiction is becoming fact".</p>

<p>"Second life is not sustainable".</p>

<p>"Reality and virtuality are becoming equal".</p>

<p>Photo of unborn child using mobile phone.</p>

<p>I'm reminded of Adam and Joe's "Goiter"...</p>

<p>Shows off skeletons of Disney characters.</p>
