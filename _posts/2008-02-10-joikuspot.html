<p>Not that I've actually tried it yet, but <a href="http://www.joikuspot.com/aboutJoikuSpot.php">JoikuSpot</a> looks gorgeous - head-slappingly obvious in retrospect (and only in retrospect) like many fantastic ideas and I suspect, genuinely disruptive. Leaving aside the irony that this positions 3G as the bearer of the "wi-fi-everywhere dream" peddled for nearly a decade now... I wonder what this'll lead to, particularly once JoikuSpot or a competing product offers not just HTTP but full internet access, and flat-rate data is more prevalent? What would the mobile equivalent of <a href="http://www.fon.com/en/">FON</a> be like? How would it differ to accommodate speed, pricing and availability fluctuations?</p>

<p>Imagine an MVNO which piggybacked not just onto one large operator with whom it has a Big Commercial Agreement in place, but all of them, quietly and unobtrusively...</p>
