<p>...so I'm listening to the excellent <a href="http://www.longnow.org/projects/seminars/podcast.php">Long Now Foundation podcasts</a> whenever I travel from A to B without something specific to think about or do (i.e. walking to work, to class, etc.) - and they're absolutely excellent, thoroughly recommended.</p>

<p>This evening, Brian Eno talking about how the Long Now Foundation were approached and asked to think about storage of nuclear waste. He relates the tale of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_Mountain">Yucca mountain storage facility</a>, designed to last for 10,000 years - and how they reckoned this was the wrong approach. 10,000 years is far too long a timescale to think sensibly about doing something so risky and it would be better to work out how to store waste reliably for 100 years - with the aim of coming back then to rethink the problem with new technology.</p>

<p>And my brain's thinking "<i>hmm... don't plan the whole thing out in advance, but do a chunk, then come back to it and replan... what does that <a href="http://www.controlchaos.com/">remind me of</a></i>".</p>

<p>Either I'm an incurable saddo, or there's a theme here. (erm, or both).</p>

<p>Whatever, hopefully I'll be the top result on google for "Agile Nuclear Waste Storage".</p>
