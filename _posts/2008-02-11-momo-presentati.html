<p>I didn't make it to the last Mobile Monday London, but two things really struck me about <a href="http://mobilemonday.org.uk/Symbian%20MoMo%20Feb%204.pdf">the presentation from David Wood of Symbian</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li> The fragmentation slide: "<em>it's always quicker to release a device-specific solution than put that functionality into the (re-usable) platform and then to a device</em>", "<em>suppliers dislike helping their competitors</em>", "<em>suppliers don't like source code changes made by their competitors</em>". Anyone know of a Googly response to this, I'm sure this slide was aimed at them?
<li> The Lean/Agile emphasis at the end of the slide, explicitly calling out Toyota as an example to be learned from. I'm quite surprised, even for a relatively developer-focused event like Mobile Monday, to see a large business like Symbian make this approach part of its offer.
</ol>
