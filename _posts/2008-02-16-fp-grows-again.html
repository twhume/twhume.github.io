<p>Another new face at <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">Future Platforms</a>: <a href="http://www.rebeccacottrell.co.uk">Rebecca Cottrell</a> is joining our design team, headed up by <a href="http://bryanrieger.blogspot.com/">Bryan Rieger</a>. I could write some pith about how our paths crossed, but she's beaten me to it and <a href="http://www.rebeccacottrell.co.uk/blog/2008/02/16/im-joining-future-platforms/">blogged it</a> more eloquently than I would've.<br />
