We're after solid Java skills (with J2ME a very welcome bonus), an ability to communicate effectively and an enthusiasm for all things mobile; in the immediate future we'd consider contract or permanent applications.</p>

<p>You'll be working on mobile-related software projects for a broad range of startups (<a href="http://www.trutap.com/">Trutap</a>, <a href="http://www.locomatrix.com/">LocoMatrix</a>, and a couple of others I can't name right now), established content owners (like the BBC, EMI, Puzzler Media, or Heinemann publishing), and a host of marcomms agencies. We're a small business (there's 15 of us last time I counted), but have been running for nearly 8 years now and have a good reputation in the world of mobile. You'd be working closely with our absolutely cracking design team, in a friendly environment with some smart people (and me).</p>

<p>On top of our service work, we also have some internal products which we actively develop, and we actively budget time for our staff for personal development and R&D. And as we're a small company, you'll get a chance to contribute to all aspects of the business: strategy, development tactics,<br />
business development and so on. If you're reading this site I've already bored you with <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2008/01/scrum-sprint-5.html">endless</a> <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2008/01/scrum-so-far-sp.html">posts</a> about how we approach the problems of developing software :)</p>

<p>If you're interested, send a CV to <a href="mailto:recruitment@futureplatforms.com">recruitment@futureplatforms.com</a>. We shan't be using recruitment agencies to fill this vacancy, and will actively avoid using any agencies who I even suspect have contacted us after reading this post.</p>
