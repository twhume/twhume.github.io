<p>Over the last year I've noticed a little pattern popping up around my work-life: that examining problems and failures in a safe environment can be very helpful. In particular I've seen this in the retrospective meeting which we run fortnightly at <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">FP</a> to examine the last 2 weeks of work, warts and all; in the <a href="http://www.hub100.org/">Hub 100</a> (now MDHub) gatherings which get a few local business owners together to talk frankly about the issues of running a small business; and in a few quiet (and private) lunches with folks from local software and design companies, talking about the gritty realities of software development and project management.</p>

<p>In every case I've had the impression that in private, folks are prepared to engage in much more honest, open and useful discussions about this stuff. So I'm wondering if there's room for a regular (monthly?) event in Brighton where we can do just this: have a manageably small (6-10?) number of people engaged in software/digital projects get together, in private, and talk about the really nasty stuff that gives us sleepless nights. I'd suggest running it under the <a href="http://www.chathamhouse.org.uk/about/chathamhouserule">Chatham House rule</a> to preserve anonymity and ensure there's no fear of the humiliation that necessarily arises from admitting you don't know everything about everything.</p>

<p>What do you think? Drop me an email if you're interested and I'll either set up or appropriate a mailing list. And if there's enough takers I'll set something up...</p>
