<p>If you're in Brighton and looking to try something a little different, you could do worse than head along to one of Mark's taster classes for <a href="http://holisticexercise.co.uk/">Holistics</a>. Mark's a good friend of mine and has combined elements of Aikido (from which I know him) with all sorts of other stuff into an unusual melange - and he's doing first the class for free, at various venues across Brighton.</p>
