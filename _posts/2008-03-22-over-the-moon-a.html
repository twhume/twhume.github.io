<p><a href="http://bryanrieger.blogspot.com/">The talented Mr Rieger</a> and I will be presenting on <a href="http://overtheair.org/blog/?p=34">day 1 of Over The Air</a>, an upcoming conference in London focused around mobile development. Expect a gentle stroll through the night sky, courtesy of the <a href="http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/nav.2857">Royal Observatory Greenwich</a> and brought to you by SVG, RSS, microformats, open APIs, the WURFL, iCAL, and the one web.</p>

<p>A small cadre of <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">Future Platforms</a> munchkins will be in attendance for the 2-day event - it's looking like a fun couple of days :)</p>
