<p>I love <a href="http://sentientdevelopments.blogspot.com/2008/03/seven-ways-to-control-galaxy-with-self.html">this article</a> about conquering the galaxy through self-replicating probes (via <a href="http://www.blackbeltjones.com/">Mr Jones</a>, I think). I reminds me of trees. In less lucid moments I've often wondered what it must be like to have to grow somewhere in order to go there.</p>
