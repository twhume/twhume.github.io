<p>A lovely Easter weekend:</p>

<ul>
<li> 4 days of lie-ins, catching up on sleep I'd bartered away over the first 3 months of 2008;
<li> 3 films - Invasion, Rendition, and Cloverfield - and I found something to enjoy in each of them;
<li> 2 and a half books read: finally finished Bruce Chatwins <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Songlines">Songlines</a> (which was absolutely fantastic), <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/">Presentation Zen</a>, and started on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Player_of_Games">The Player of Games</a> (to my shame, the first Culture novel I've read);
<li> 1 tech sabbath: I switched off my mobile and laptop for Sunday, and kept them switched off. It felt horrific for the first 12 hours, lovely for the second 12 :)
</ul>

<p>All that plus a night out with the Good Doctor, Dangermouse Dave's birthday bash and a succession of meals and cake.</p>

<p>So now I'm rested and relaxed - a good thing, with a busy few weeks ahead: our fortnightly <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2008/01/scrum-so-far-sp.html">planning day</a> on Wednesday followed by a Girl Geek Dinner, <a href="http://www.iir-events.com/IIR-conf/Telecoms/EventView.aspx?EventID=1366&SearchResult=http%3a%2f%2fwww.iir-events.com%2fIIR-conf%2fTelecoms%2fSearchEvents.aspx">Mobile Internet</a> in Berlin the following week, <a href="http://overtheair.org/blog/">Over The Air in London</a> the Friday after I return, the first <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2008/02/chatham-house-s.html">"Chatham House" software meet</a> the following week and a trip to <a href="http://www.airenjuku-london.org/">Airenjuku London</a> (mob-handed, I suspect) to say au revoir to Chris on the 12th April...</p>
