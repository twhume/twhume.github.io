<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/2392193925/" title="Rapt audience by twhume, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3043/2392193925_03159d8083_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Rapt audience" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10"/></a>So, I'm back from <a href="http://overtheair.org/blog/">OverTheAir</a> now, and just about caught up on sleep :)</p>

<p>I thought the event was absolutely excellent: a broad selection of topics for the talks (with 5 or so tracks running at any given time), an interesting selection of attendees (including plenty of folks from outside the usual crowd of mobile faces), and a brilliant atmosphere of collaboration. In particular the event seemed free from some of the operator-bashing which has a tendency to infect industry get-togethers; and I found the individual sessions to be particularly conversational (both those I attended and the talk that <a href="http://bryanrieger.com/">Bryan</a> and I gave). It was really great to be able to discuss the realities of, say, mobile testing or approaches to mobile/web development with a crowd of smart people, all coming at the same problems from different perspectives.</p>

<p>In particular I enjoyed the <a href="http://flinglog.com/">Brian Fling</a> talk, which managed to get even me worked up and enthusiastic about the way things are going (though I think it would be difficult for me, or indeed anyone, to equal the enthusiasm Brian shows for the iPhone).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/2392206493/" title="Dougie and his fuel by twhume, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3145/2392206493_3fc93660db_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Dougie and his fuel" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5"/></a>The wi-fi was, I think, the best of any event I've ever attended: absolutely rock solid and snappy. The food was good, and the accommodation (which consisted of bean bags on a wooden floor) quite pleasant. Sleeping in my clothes for 3 hours before breakfast on Saturday morning left me a little... "fragrant", but what the hey :) And the few problems there were (the fire alarm leading to an evacuation on Friday) seemed to be passed over without trouble - a consequence of diligence by the organisers, I suspect.</p>

<p>I'll post separately about the two places where <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">Future Platforms</a> got most involved: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bryanrieger/prime-sky">the talk that Bryan and I gave</a> about the PrimeSky astronomy project we've been doing for the <a href="http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/nav.2857">Royal Observatory Greenwich</a>, and our entry into the hack competition.</p>

<p>And I can't wait for the next event. Rumour has it there might be something hosted by the MoMo Amsterdam folks which could be interesting.
