<p>Talking of <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">FP</a>... we've been rubbish at talking about what we're doing. So excuse me if I go a little salesy, but I thought I'd use this platform to mention some of the stuff we've been doing this year:</p>

<ul>
<li> We're working for half of <a href="http://www.nokia.co.uk/">Nokia's</a> design teams in the UK, implementing handset themes onto a range of devices which have come to market so far in 2008, and will be continuing to arrive throughout the year;
<li> Top-secret design work for a large international agency. Can't say any more;
<li> Piles of design and product development for <a href="http://www.trutap.com/">trutap</a> - there's some really great stuff going on here which I'll share more about in the next few montsh;
<li> Some concept work for the <a href="http://labs.lastminute.com/">LastMinute.com Labs</a> team (when I'm not <a href="http://overtheair.org/blog/?tag=overtheair-overtheair08-lastminutecom-phonefight-mobil">trying to cleave them in half</a>, virtually), and <a href="http://www.channel4.co.uk/">Channel 4</a> - both of whom have contributed to our healthy collection of NDAs, so no details here I'm afraid;
<li> Mobile web development for the <a href="http://www.rog.nmm.ac.uk/">Royal Observatory Greenwich</a> (see the presentation Bryan and I gave at Over The Air here), and for a font distributor - coming soon!
<li> More game development for <a href="http://www.locomatrix.com/">LocoMatrix</a>;
<li> Nifty bits of Bluetooth work for <a href="http://www.wk.com/">Wieden & Kennedy</a>, to support an ad campaign for Save The Children, and for CuteCircuit - who sell a really T-shirt that beams hugs over mobile phones. Honest.
</ul>

<p>Phew. Oh and there's all the stuff that's so secret I can't even breathe about it, of course... ;)</p>
