<p><a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">We're</a> looking for a Senior Designer to join our in-house design team. Here's the job spec in pure job-speak:</p>

<p>"<i>Based from our offices in central Brighton, you'll work closely with our customers, our development team and third party suppliers to define and build delightful mobile software products. Commercial experience of mobile design and an absolute passion for the medium will be essential, as will strong interaction design skills and a solid understanding of the technical constraints of the medium. Externally you'll be representing us to the design community; internally you'll be responsible for honing and refining our approach and techniques.</p>

<p>Future Platforms is an 8-year old UK software business employing 14 members of staff. We live by the seaside and build delightful mobile products for a diverse range of clients. In the last year we've worked on customising handset themes for Nokia, mobile social software for Trutap, concept development for Channel 4, won a place on the BBC Innovation Labs scheme, and helped Discovery US viewers hunt ghosts across America.</p>

<p>Email a CV and covering letter to recruitment@futureplatforms.com if you're interested.</p>

<p>Truly, madly, deeply, no agencies please. Really, please don't</i>"</p>

<p>That last bit about agencies is so important. Every time I post a job ad I get inundated by calls from agencies, write down their names, and resolve never to use them.</p>
