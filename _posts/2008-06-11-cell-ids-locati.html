<p>So, Google has 'fessed up how they've been <a href="http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2008/06/google-enables-location-aware.html">building their database of cell IDs</a>. Apple use such a database of cells to location-enable the iPhone v1 mapping applications; whilst the spangly new iPhone has onboard GPS to improve accuracy in this respect, I've found cell ID to be extremely useful when combined with a decent map.</p>

<p>And for the rest of us, there are stirling efforts like <a href="http://www.opencellid.org/users/staticShow/download">OpenCellID</a> to help build an open database of cell ID to lat/long mappings... with a nice downloadable client to let those of us with GPS-enabled phones to contribute. </p>
