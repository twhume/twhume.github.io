<p>I've been meaning to post up a little summary of the news on LocoMatrix. There's been quite a lot happening here over the last few months:</p>

<ul>
<li> We've been selected to receive a grant from the Technology Strategy Board's Creative Industries programme. It's a joint proposal with Brighton University, all themed around creating tools to assist with authoring games: a really important part of Loco. With a couple of radically different game formats already out <a href="http://www.locomatrix.com/wordpress/?p=63">there</a>, we're keen to get some third parties using the platform and seeing how their perception of what they need differs from or matches up our thinking so far.</li>
<li> Whilst we're on the topic of education, we're working with Portsmouth University on a collaborative project starting before the end of this year, the aim being to work with MSc students there on game authoring.</li>
<li> A nice <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blackbeltjones/2765529924/">double-page spread</a> appeared in London Lite, accompanying a story about location-based gaming which featured Loco quite prominently.
<li> New Scientist also ran <a href="http://technology.newscientist.com/article/dn14470-gps-cellphones-to-unleash-gamers-onto-the-streets.html">a story on real-world gaming</a>, in which Loco MD Richard Vahrman was interviewed.
</ul>
