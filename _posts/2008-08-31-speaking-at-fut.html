<p>After <a href="http://future-of-mobile.com/2008/london/pastevents">last years event</a>, where I did a panel session discussing mobile user experience with <a href="http://www.pmn.co.uk/">Marek Pawlowski</a>, I've been invited back to talk again at the <a href="http://">Future of Mobile 2008</a>.</p>

<p>I'll be drawing on the experiences we've had at FP of delivering mobile services across a whole range of technologies, and talking about to decide where to put in effort when building and launching your product.</p>

<p>The quality of other speakers is, I'll confess, a little intimidating: many faces that'll be familiar from the London mobile scene (plus a few folks I've not had the pleasure of meeting yet), ending with what I'm sure will be a heated panel fight^H^H^H^H^Hdiscussion chaired by Mike Butcher.</p>

<p>Slightly lower-key, it's <a href="http://barcampbrighton.org/">Brighton Barcamp 3</a> next weekend (following closely on the heels of <a href="http://2008.dconstruct.org/">dConstruct 2008</a>, which has been keeping <a href="http://wellieswithwings.blogspot.com/">Soph</a> out of mischief for the last few months). Last year I was running on empty after travelling back from <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2007/09/burning-man.html">Black Rock City</a>. This year I hope to actually stay awake long enough to do a talk... which looks like it'll either involve presenting our experiences adopting Scrum over the last year, or something about software development, martial arts and craftmanship (presuming I can OTA mind-meld with <a href="http://www.fudebakudo.com/blog/">Mr Whiteland</a> between now and then).</p>

<p>If you're coming and have any preference, do comment! From discussions with <a href="http://www.rebeccacottrell.co.uk/blog/">Ms Cottrell</a> in the office and <a href="http://www.paulsilver.co.uk/">Mr Silver</a> at the <a href="http://brightonsocialmediacafe.pbwiki.com/">Tuttle club</a> on Saturday, I think there's going to be a range of really interesting stuff going on...</p>
