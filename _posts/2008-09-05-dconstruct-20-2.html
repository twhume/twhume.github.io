<p><strong>dConstruct 2008: Joshua Porter, Leveraging Cognitive Bias in Social Design</strong></p>

<p>Web design is now about psychology; web designers need to learn about it to create decent experiences.</p>

<p>"Bandwagon effect": people often do and believe things because many other people do and believe things.</p>

<p>Heuristics: rules of thumb which prevent us from needing to gather all information required to make a judgement. Sometimes these don't work all that well - this is cognitive bias.  e.g. "Not Invented Here", prediction biases which lead to underestimates of time to work.</p>

<p>Seminal paper on this is "Judgement under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases (1974)"</p>

<p>Talks about a few biases:</p>

<ol>
<li> Representation Bias.
<li> Loss Aversion.
<li> Ownership Bias.
</ol>

<p>These sometimes combine: in the sign-up problem, loss avertsion and ownership bias overvalue what they use by a factor of 3. Because of ownership and prediction biases, software manufacturers overvalue their products by about 3x - so there's a combined 9x dissonance between what they want to charge and what users want to pay.</p>

<p>Demonstrates Freshbooks, which emphasises number of users through a worldwide map showing them (encouraging bandwagon effect).</p>

<p>Q: isn't this evil?<br />
A: It's more about business ethics.</p>

<p>(Sounds like a "guns don't kill people, people do" type argument).</p>
