<p><strong>dConstruct 2008: Tantek Celik: Social Network Portability</strong></p>

<p>Why does every social site make you</p>

<ol>
<li> re-enter your personal information?
<li> re-add all your friends?
<li> turn off notifications?
<li> re-specify privacy preferences?
<li> re-block negative people?
</ol>

<p>Keeping multiple sources of info (social networks etc.) up-to-date is a maintenance problem.</p>

<p>The goal should be giving users complete control over their data. Portable data + consistent URL = data syndicatability.</p>

<p>Had an interesting chat with Mr Thorpe after this one, who raised the point that in many cases, you don't want to share your identity between sites: you want to maintain many identities and quite specifically compartmentalise them.</p>

<p>Leaving aside whether we can enable people to express very instinctual and deep-seated behaviour explicitly... will they want to? Could we take the N different inconsistent versions of ourselves that we project in the real world (all the time lying to those we project to that yes, they're seeing the genuine article), XML-encode them and set them in concrete online?</p>
