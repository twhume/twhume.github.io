<p>So, Barcamp Brighton 3: absolutely fantastic. I'll scratch down a few thoughts before they evaporate:</p>

<ul>
<li> Really annoyed I missed <a href="http://www.paulsilver.co.uk/">Paul Silver</a> talk on social networks and death: he brought it up at Tuttle last week and it sounded really great;
<li> Saw 2 talks on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_(software)">Selenium</a>: I am going to be force-feeding this to our QAs until they burst;
<li> The last afternoon was appropriate New Age, given that we were in Brighton. Sunday closed for me with a yoga session with <a href="http://www.yogajenny.com/">Jenny</a>, meditation and GTD with Michael Rose, then a retrospective on the whole of Barcamp ably facilitated by <a href="http://www.bluejoh.com/">Joh</a>;
<li> The highlight was <a href="http://www.rebeccacottrell.co.uk/blog/">Rebecca</a> talking on typography and design, which seemed to be the best-attended of the whole event (necessitating a mid-point shift in venue) and generated some really good debate afterwards. No <a href="http://tantek.com/">Tantek</a>, there is no repository of mobile typography. Yes <a href="http://tantek.com/">Tantek</a>, mobile fragmentation really *is* that bad. 
<li> I also really enjoyed <a href="http://www.orbific.com/">James</a>' skit on Derrida and XKCD (so much that I forgot my promise of a good kicking if he ever mentioned Big D again), and the session which combined Thai OCR, DNA sequencing and minority African languages... but ended up being a database optimisation back-and-forth with the audience :)
<li> We decamped to a dark corner for the warts and all of Scrum - my talk on the last year at FP, which I may be repeating locally in the near future...
</ul>

<p>The only low point for me was the university food - but hey, out of everything that had to be organised and put together to bring an event of this scale to fruition, that's quite properly a long way down the list.</p>

<p>Already looking forward to the next one :)</p>
