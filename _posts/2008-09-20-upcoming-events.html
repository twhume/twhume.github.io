<p>So, I'm back from a weeks holiday and full of beans, and looking at my diary the next few months are fuller than I realised:</p>

<ul>
<li> I'll be attending the <a href="http://www.bahbas.org.uk/">Brighton and Hove Business Awards</a> next Friday (26th September), where <a href="http://www.locomatrix.com/">LocoMatrix</a> has been shortlisted for Most Awesome Use of Digital Media;
<li> On 29th September I'm heading up to a SkillsMatter talk on <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/agile-scrum/pragmatic-agility">Pragmatic Agility</a>. If you've never been to one of these, I thoroughly recommend them;
<li> The next day I'm on a panel at a <a href="http://www.mashupevent.com/event/mashup-event-iphone-android-symbian">Mashup event</a> being held at the offices of BBH, on the topic of iPhone, Android and Symbian;
<li> On 15th October <a href="http://www.eventyr.co.uk/">Joh</a> and I will be doing a talk at the <a href="http://thewerks.org.uk/">Werks</a> in Brighton, expanding on my Barcamp presentation to cover off our experiences adopting Scrum at Future Platforms - very much following on from the talk we gave at SkillSwap <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2007/11/agile-skillswap.html">nearly a year ago</a>.
<li> The <a href="http://www.smartphoneshow.com/">Symbian Smartphone Show</a> follows on 21st and 22nd October; I'm expecting this one to be particularly interesting, given the changes going on in mobile right now;
<li> On 6th November I'll be talking at the Sussex University <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/enterprise/1-2-1.html">Enterprising Engineers</a> evening, on experiences at Future Platforms building all sorts of lovely mobile products;
<li> And last but not least, I'll be speaking at 
<a href="http://future-of-mobile.com/2008/london">Future of Mobile London</a> on 17th November, on the strengths, weaknesses and tradeoffs of various mobile platforms;
</ul>

<p>Phew. All that and the <a href="http://www.brooksbrighton10k.co.uk/">Brooks 10k run</a> on 16th November to keep me busy ;)</p>

<p>If you're going to any of the above and fancy catching up for a chat, do drop me a line...<br />
