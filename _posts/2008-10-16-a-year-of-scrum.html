<p>So, <a href="http://www.bluejoh.com/">Joh</a> and I did our talk last night at <a href="http://thewerks.org.uk/">The Werks</a> - attempting to summarise experiences from the last year at <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">Future Platforms</a>, since we formally adopted <a href="http://www.controlchaos.com/">Scrum</a> for all our development processes.</p>

<p>I managed to get delayed slightly in London, and managed to arrive at Hove station a mere 3 minutes before we were due to start: oh the irony of arriving late when you're giving a talk about delivering products on time. But fortunately things were slightly behind schedule already and no-one seemed to notice.</p>

<p>The talk itself went OK; it was a rerun of, and expansion upon, a half-hour piece I pulled together for <a href="http://barcampbrighton.org/">Barcamp Brighton</a> a month or so back... and the Barcamp talk itself was a follow-on from one Joh and I gave at <a href="http://skillswap-brighton.org/">SkillSwap</a> last year, summarising our experiences a week into Scrum. So I was pretty familiar with the material, although I made a point of adding in lots of (sanitised and anonymised) data from real projects we've been running.</p>

<p>There's far too much to go into here, and if you've been reading this site you'll have read quite a bit of it already. Plus I have to save *something* to say to people I meet in real life. But if you attended, you might find <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/twh/a-year-of-scrum-presentation">these annotated slides</a> handy - I've taken the ones we showed on the night and added in a few notes here and there which might jog your memory on the points I was making as I went through them. Beware, for as a wise man says: if the slides make sense without my being there, there's no point in my presenting them; and if they don't make sense without me, you won't get much value from them. Caveat emptor :)</p>

<p>I was given an hour to do this skit, and with questions we ended up using just shy of two hours, which is the longest I think I've ever spoken publicly. With that warning in mind, if you'd like to chat about this sort of thing or find out more, do give me a shout: tom dot hume at future platforms dot com</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://fluctisonous.com/">James McCarthy</a> and <a href="http://rosiesherry.com/">Rosie Sherry</a> for organising everything, to <a href="http://www.bluejoh.com/">Joh</a> for gamely keeping me on the straight and narrow once more, and everyone who came along for making it so much fun :)</p>
