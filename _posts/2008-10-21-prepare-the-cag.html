<p>I've been reading <a href="http://www.agileproductdesign.com/blog/">Jeff Pattons blog</a> (or rather, re-reading). There's so much good stuff in here it hurts:</p>

<ul>
<li> On <a href="http://www.agileproductdesign.com/blog/acurate_estimate_red_herring.html">estimates</a>: "<i>Treat estimates given at the outset of a project as a budget for some possible solution, not as a bid for one specific solution.</i>"
<li> On <a href="http://www.agileproductdesign.com/blog/consider_changing_your_products_ui_more_frequently.html">changing your products UI more frequently</a>: "<i>What would a design and development process look like that encouraged frequent small change to user experience?</i>"
<li> On <a href="http://www.agileproductdesign.com/blog/agile_product_development.html">agile product design and development</a>: "<i>This stuff is difficult. There isnâ€™t an instruction manual to follow.</i>"
</li> On <a href="http://www.agileproductdesign.com/blog/dirty_hands_required.html">getting design and dev working together</a>: "<i>If you want your product design and development to be effective, put someone on staff who's both a strong designer and technically capable of making design changes to the product directly.</i>"
</ul>

<p>I had the good fortune to meet Jeff at <a href="http://www.xpday.org/">XP Day</a> last year, wibbled at him and got some good advice. If I ever meet him again I'm going to drug him, abduct him, and keep him in a cage at FPHQ.</p>

<p>/me waves at Jeff.</p>
