<p>So, Trutap has <a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com/2008/10/29/trutap-races-to-be-mobile-im-aggregator-of-choice/">launched a load more IM transports</a>, putting the app well on the path to being the best connected mobile IM service in the world. Not that we can take much credit for this (beyond the front-end and MIDlet which we created) - the server team at TTHQ have done a stirling job here.</p>

<p>But we've been busy beavers nonetheless. All will be revealed in the coming weeks :)</p>
