AIKIBUNKER! by twhume, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3033/3022299944_b2786fca20_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="DANGER! AIKIBUNKER!" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" /></a>...I had a lovely weekend out, mostly spent catch up with Aikido folks in the south-east. On Saturday morning Mr Helsby and I took a train (and attendant rail replacement bus service) up to SOAS to train with Sue Smith and the <a href="http://www.airenjuku-london.org/">Airenjuku London</a> crowd, in the basement bunker which serves as their little shed.</p>

<p>Then the next morning 8 of us from <a href="http://www.airenjuku.org/">Airenjuku Brighton</a> drove over to Southampton to pay a visit to the Southampton University club - something we've been meaning to do ever since summer school in Chester this August. The Southampton guys made us feel very welcome, <a href="http://www.soton.ac.uk/~aikido/instructors.html">Alex Megann</a> taught a fantastic class with Tom, and we sampled the delights of an indian buffet at Cafe Mumbai afterwards...</p>

<p>...driving back (or rather, being propelled half-asleep in my case: I was in the Land of Nod for the whole journey) just in time for our regular Sunday evening transmission.</p>

<p>Lovely, and not a mobile phone or laptop in sight ;)</p>

<p>And whilst I have your attention, take a look at these rather <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=-MsoztOsg6Y">natty</a> <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=UdAoxc5XvNE">videos</a> done by some aiki/tech lunatics with motion sensors and some <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=5HxciVuIbKE">interesting</a> <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=781-_YXtBKs">visualisation</a> <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=B-YlIveeC-I">software</a>: beautiful stuff.<br />
