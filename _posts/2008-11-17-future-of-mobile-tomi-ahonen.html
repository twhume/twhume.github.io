<p>Mobile is as different from the internet as TV is different from radio.</p>

<p>All the concepts for TV we have today cannot migrate back to radio, though they did evolve from.</p>

<p>91% of mobile owners keep the phone within 3 feet, 24x7</p>

<p>Mobile is as addictive as smoking cigarettes. Removing mobile phones produces similar withdrawal pains as attempting to stop smoking.</p>

<p>Text-and-driving is more dangerous than stoned or drunk driving.</p>

<p>63% of people are not willing to share their phone with our spouse.</p>

<p>1 in 3 partners snoop inside the phone, mostly when we're in the shower. 10% of people ended relationships after this.</p>

<p>1 in 4 British couples sleeps apart 1 night a week because of their partners addiction to Blackberry, phones, etc.</p>

<p>Mass media are print, recordings, cinema, radio, television, internet, mobile.</p>

<p>What is print doing in a presentation with mobile? In Japan, mobile books sold Â¢82m mobile books in 2006. 5/10 best-selling printed books started as mobile books. Books are written on phones using text-messaging, spelling and style.</p>

<p>The internet subsumed media that came before, and added interactivity. Look at Habbo Hotel for an example of a fixed internet service which raised revenue through mobile: by using billing.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mice_Love_Rice">Mice Love Rice</a>: a song released for free on the internet. Sold as a ringback tone, raising $22m. Ringback tones have to be enabled by operators.</p>

<p>Don't try to copy the internet: create something new.</p>

<p>Mobile has seven advantages over internet: personal, permanently connected, always carried, built-in payment, present at creative impulse, most accurate audience, captures social context.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.carbondiem.com/product.html">Carbon Diem</a>: location-based service tracking how your mobile moves, discovering speed of movement and inferring carbon usage. Young people care more about green issues; for Tomi's generation WW3 was the threat.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tohato">Tohato</a>: Japanese snack brand, introduced 2 new snack brands: Satan Jorquia and Habanero. Invited customers to choose a brand and fight the other brand in the "worlds worst war". Gamers joined by scanning a 2d barcode in a bag. Recruiting friends earned promotion in the army - all done via mobile, battles scheduled at 4am, with a 24-hour gaming news channel.</p>

<p>Hoshi-Ichi Maniac: mass participation TV format in Japan, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, knock-out style quiz. 200k live players on the first run.</p>

<p>"Create services that are so amazing that the first time someone uses it, people think they're magic" - e.g. Kamera Jiten, a cameraphone translator which takes photos and translates them English to Japanese.<br />
