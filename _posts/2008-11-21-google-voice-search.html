<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/14/technology/internet/14voice.html?_r=2&oref=slogin">Google Voice Search</a> is, frankly, amazing. Not because it works well. Most of my searches so far have been comically misinterpreted, though I note that (for research purposes only you understand) "Britney Spears" has a 100% success rate, even when I don't  employ my appalling California accent.</p>

<p>No - to me, it's the sheer chutzpah of doing something like this, and the laser-like focus on reducing the time between deciding your wanting to know something, and Google giving it to you. I touched on this topic briefly in <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/twh/strengths-weakness-and-tradeoffs-of-mobile-platforms-presentation/">my talk</a> on Monday at Future of Mobile, and Tim O'Reilly has <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/11/voice-in-google-mobile-app-tipping-point.html">a nice post</a> about mobile being the lynchpin between humans and the cloud - spot on.</p>

<p>Can you imagine what sort of world we'll live in in 5 years time, when improvements in voice recognition (probably based around brute-force techniques rather than smart voice recognition algorithms - scale's just another tool to these guys) put an increasing percentage of our species' collective knowledge even closer? Beautiful. </p>
