<p>Jakob Nielsen has put out an interesting Alertbox post on <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/agile-methods.html">Agile Development Projects and Usability</a>. I was going to write a little about what I thought of his post, but then I found that Alastair Cockburn had managed to do <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Nielsen+on+agile+and+usability">a much better job of it</a> than I could. Basically: all fantastic, bar the us-versus-them split that the article sets up by saying "<em>Agile’s biggest threat to system quality stems from the fact that it’s a method proposed by programmers</em>".</p>
