<p>An <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/theinfonaut/are-agile-projects-doomed-to-halfbaked-design">interesting presentation on agile design</a>; a rerun of <a href="http://interaction08.ixda.org/Jeff_White%20and%20Jim%20Ungar.php">a good talk on Design Studios</a> in the agile process; and an <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/gettingrealaboutagiledesign">article about getting real with agile and design</a>.</p>

<p>One of the things I was quite surprised about at <a href="http://www.xpday.org/">XP Day</a> was how little talk I found around integrating design and development. I suspected at first that this might be because (a) there's no hard-and-fast rules or (b) everyone was sick of talking about it and going round in circles, but <a href="http://bluejoh.com/">Joh</a> corrected me. I should've proposed an open space about it, but a combination of being fascinated by everything else there and a little ill on the morning of day two put a stop to that - ah well.</p>

<p>I'm doing a talk at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/uxcorner/calendar/9200276/">UX Matters</a> in January, and I think I might try and draw together a few lessons we've learned over the last few years at FP. In the interests of massaging these into a coherent form, a few thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li> I don't think that designers and developers are as far apart in aspirations as they're sometimes presented. I don't see a love of documentation, or producing documentation, from either side. Good people from both disciplines relish communication, create models and prototypes, and accept change (often managed through iteration).
<li> My own output gets better when I work collaboratively and with folks from different disciplines (usually pigeonholed as design, development and business). I don't believe I'm atypical here.
<li> The terms "design" and "development" are each placeholders for a set of activities, some of which are more easily estimated and managed than others.
<li> Design, development and the business are heavily intertwingled: decisions made in one area frequently impact on the others. Reducing the cultural or geographic distance between them speeds decision-making.
</ul>

<p>Oh, and if you get a chance avail yourself of a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/HCI-Remixed-Reflections-Influenced-Community/dp/0262050889">HCI Remixed</a> - it's a series of essays from top-notch HCI types (Bill Buxton, Scott Jenson and Terry Winograd all stood out for me) on works that influenced them. Very dip-innable, and a few gems here.</p>
