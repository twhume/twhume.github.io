<p>Strand Consulting has <a href="http://www.strandreports.com/sw3501.asp">a report on the iPhone</a>: "<i>The fact that the iPhone is currently receiving so much attention from the press is probably due to an uncritical press that have allowed themselves to be seduced by Apple's unique PR machine - and that have not analysed and examined the underlying business models and the financial success of the iPhone from an operatorâ€™s point of view.</i>"</p>

<p>I last saw John Strand talk <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2005/11/world_telemedia.html">a few years back</a> at World Telemedia, and first came across him when he gave European operators launching I-Mode a right ticking off several years before that. History proved him right on European I-mode, but I'm not convinced that everything he said last time about niche MVNOs has come to pass here in the UK (though I suspect it has, *somewhere*). It's nonetheless interesting to hear some well-informed views on the iPhone from someone well grounded in telco-land.</p>
