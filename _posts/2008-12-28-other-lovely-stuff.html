<p>And last but not least, a few bits and pieces that don't fit into any box, but are lovely nonetheless:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/5043012/afrika-a-game-where-you-cant-shoot-the-animals">Afrika</a>, a PS3 wildlife game where you photograph animals. Ahem, "first-person shooter".
<li> <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2008/09/25/wire-arc">Story arcs and The Wire</a>. The Wire followed BSG as the second ever TV series I've bought the DVDs of and plodded through - and has delivered way more enjoyment than the slightly beautifully-started yet damp-squibbish Galactica has so far managed.
<li> <a href="http://www.sixtostart.com/onetoread/2008/everything-you-know-about-args-is-wrong/">Everything you know about ARGs is wrong</a>, from Dan Hon. Dan channels Charlie Brooker and burns his boat. Mobile-obsessed myself, I'm wondering when it'll be safe to drop gratuitous multi-platformness that seems to infect the genre in favour of a game that you just play all the time with your phone.
<li> Iain Tate of Poke on <a href="http://www.crackunit.com/2008/12/22/my-talk-from-playful-in-october/">high scores</a>
</ul>
