<p>These three have set in the left-hand-side of my Firefox tabs list for most of the year. I've come back to them again and again and will continue to do so :)</p>

<ul>
<li> Jeff Patton on <a href="http://www.agileproductdesign.com/blog/emerging_best_agile_ux_practice.html">Twelve emerging best practices for adding UX work to Agile development</a>: "<i>Let's recap. Two secrets to success in software development are: 1. Start sooner2. Build less software</i>".
<li> Alan Cooper on <a href="http://www.cooper.com/journal/2008/07/bringing_sanity.html">Bringing sanity to swat-team design projects</a>: "<i>With increasing demand for design â€œ"swat teams" to rescue fully developed but flawed software that is scheduled to ship within months or even weeks, the critical question becomes: how can you avoid getting caught up in the chaos that frequently permeates "crisis-mode" engagements?</i>"
<li> <a href="http://danube.com/blog/michaeljames/a_scrummasters_checklist">A Scrum-Masters Checklist</a>. Q1 of this year I need to print this out and track myself against it.
</ul>
