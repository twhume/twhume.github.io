<p>...my two favourite web services:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://photojojo.com/timecapsule/">PhotoJoJo's Time Capsule</a>, which emails me monthly with a few (random) pictures from my Flickr, but a year ago. I really look forward to these little enforced walks down memory lane.
<li> <a href="http://doodle.com/main.html">Doodle</a>, a beautifully simple meeting-arranger/decision-marker app. No sign-up, no frills, no advertising, but does what it does to perfection.
</ul>
