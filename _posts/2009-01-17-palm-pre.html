<p>Allow me to join the throng of people punching the air with delight on the news of Palms upcoming return. I was a loyal Pilot and Vx user long before I got the mobile bug, and still have happy memories of the platform... and as it happened, the very first project that FP delivered was a native Palm application. The Palm story is one of my favourites, too: a small team (7 people I believe), laser-like focus on user experience, delivering a great product that went against conventional wisdom of the time:  remember that handhelds post-Newton and post-Go were considered tried-and-failed. Check out <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Designing-Interactions-B-Moggridge/dp/0262134748">Designing Interactions</a> for a good couple of interviews with Hawkins and Haitani.</p>

<p>So, the Pre interests me for lots of personal reasons, let alone fact that it's demonstrably possible, post-iPhone, for someone to launch an entirely new platform and put a new and strong-looking competitor into the market. Sure, a new platform - particularly a decent one - once more exaggerates the problems of fragmentation that plague mobile, but it seems churlish to complain about a device that seems to deliver fresh thinking, decently executed.</p>

<p>So, some links and commentary:</p>

<li> A <a href="http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2009/01/08/hands-on-with-the-palm-pre-tons-of-photos/">hands-on review</a> with lots of photos;
<li> Initial pricing appears to be <a href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/2009/1/palm-may-sell-pre-for-149-palm">low - $149?</a>
<li> Palm are "<a href="http://mobileopportunity.blogspot.com/2009/01/palm-pre-think-similar.html">definitely interesting</a>", "<a href="http://i.gizmodo.com/5126702/palm-pre-preview-simply-amazing">simply amazing</a>", and have "<a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/blog/2009/01/11/2241">made a splash</a>"
<li> Palm WebOS <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/01/12/welcome_back_palm/">won't be backwards compatible</a>, but really, who cares?
<li> The <a href="http://developer.palm.com/">developer site</a> already talks of an application framework built on web technologies, deep handset integration via JSON, and the now-obligatory on-device application store (though <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/01/10/palms-app-store-christened-app-catalog-games-not-a-priority/">not with games as a priority</a>, apparently).
</ul>

<p>And is it my imagination, or is the name Pre, and much of the <a href="http://www.palm.com/us/products/phones/pre/index.html">marketing going along with it</a>, a weird homage to Jeff Hawkins' (founder of Palm v1) theories on the predictive nature of our brains?<br />
