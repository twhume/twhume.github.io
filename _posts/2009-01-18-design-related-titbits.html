<ul>
<li> Phil Gyford has some nice ideas on <a href="http://www.gyford.com/phil/writing/2008/12/30/ebooks_stanza.php">digitally representing books</a>;
<li> Transcript of an interesting conversation between Alan Cooper and Kent Beck: <a href="http://unthinkingly.com/extreme-programming-vs-interaction-design/">Extreme Programming vs Interaction Design</a>. In particular I had a minor "aha" moment understanding Alan when I read that he's "<em>advocating interaction design, which is much more akin to requirements planning than it is to interface design</em>". I'd always seen it as much more interface- than requirements- related;
<li> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_model">Kano model</a>; nothing new, but nice to read it;
<li> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/amyjokim/putting-the-fun-in-functiona">Putting the fun into functional</a>, a lovely slideshow on taking lessons learned from gaming and applying them to (predominately social) software;
<li> Another piece, an interview this time on <a href="http://bokardo.com/archives/game-mechanics-for-interaction-design-an-interview-with-amy-jo-kim/">game mechanics for interaction design</a>;
<li> <a href="http://bryanrieger.com/">Bryan</a> has a characteristically excellent article on <a href="http://mobiforge.com/designing/story/effective-design-multiple-screen-sizes">effective design for multiple screen sizes</a>;
<li> <a href="http://whitneyhess.com/blog/">Whitney Hess</a> on <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/01/09/user-experience-design">what user experience design isn't</a>: +1, +1, +1;
<li> The <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9124740">importance of control in product design</a>: "<i>Give me control, and I will love your product. It's as simple as that.</i>"
<li> Will less popular languages suffer from <a href="http://blog.longnow.org/2009/01/03/sms-save-my-language/">limited support via predictive text</a>?
<li> Apple is patenting more touch-screen goodness, this time <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/12/29/swipe_patent/">swipe gestures</a>. I'm presuming Palm are doing the same :(
