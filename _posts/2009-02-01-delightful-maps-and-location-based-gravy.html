<p><a href="http://www.smule.com">Smule</a> have a lot to answer for.</p>

<p>In odd moments on train journeys, waiting for meetings or when bored of television, I'm finding myself turning to one of their apps with increasing frequency. I first came across these guys when someone played the <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=RhCJq7EAJJA">Ocarina video</a> at <a href="http://events.carsonified.com/fom/2008/london/content">Future of Mobile</a> last year, and I've downloaded a few of their apps since then: the <a href="http://ocarina.smule.com/">Ocarina</a> itself, <a href="http://www.smule.com/products/soniclighter/">SonicLighter</a>, and most recently <a href="http://www.smule.com/products/zephyr/">Zephyr</a>.</p>

<p>I suppose the best way of describing these would be social, geographic toys: do something, and see other people round the world doing similar things. In the case of SonicLighter, all you're doing is running the app; there's a screen when it begins where you flick-start a virtual cigarette lighter, but all the action occurs on a world-map where you can see locations from which other SonicLighter owners have used the app in the last 24 hours. </p>

<p>Ocarina and Zephyr take this principle and make it more expressive - in the case of the former, you play a song on your iPhone or hear other songs being played around the world (together with a lovely visual representation of where they're coming from, on a nicely drawn globe). Zephyr lets you trace out a message on the screen of your iPhone, send it off on its travels around the world, and brings other messages to you.</p>

<p>It's difficult to overemphasise how cute I find this stuff, and how much I get simply from being aware that there are other people out there, anonymous to me except for their location and the fact that they're doing the same thing as me: the connection is the meat here, and the activity around it just gravy. There's something wonderful and very human about seeing a message slowly get etched out onto your screen, after watching it ebb its way across the Atlantic Ocean, or bounce from city to city.</p>

<p>And of course, Smule have done a great job of keeping the whole experience smooth: no registration required, good maps, and a carefree exploration of the apps seems to be encouraged throughout.</p>

<p>I also note that they're starting to do a bit more with them. SonicLighter now asks me "who I'm lighting up for" and gives a number of options. Here's a distribution of who lit up for who in the recent US election:</p>

<p align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/3243647985/" title="US Elections via SonicLighter by twhume, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3324/3243647985_5a945756a1_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" alt="US Elections via SonicLighter" /></a></p>

<p>Lessons learned here? The connection can be the application. The trivial can become interesting when you can see others doing it at a distance (perhaps only then). Identity isn't a necessity for social software - I don't know or care who the other people are on these apps, that's half the fun. And location-based apps can be delightful too :)</p>
