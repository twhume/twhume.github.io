<p>Mobile phone sales are polarising, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/feb/04/vodafone-nokia-mobile-phones">apparently</a>: "<i>it is clear that people are either getting devices that have functionality that really adds something to their life - making their life better, more enjoyable or more productive - or they are going for a cheaper type of deal</i>"</p>

<p>One of the things that Trutap surprised me with was the revelation (to me at least) that in "developing" markets like India, smartphones are a popular choice despite their high cost relative to average incomes... the rationalisation being that if you're going to spend a greater chunk of your income on a mobile device, it had better be a decent one, and something you'll keep for a long time.</p>

<p>Recession hits the UK, and it looks like the same cost-conscious behaviour follows in its wake...</p>
