<p>Once again, I'll be missing Mobile World Congress - and thus an opportunity to catch up with <a href="http://www.domi.co.uk/">Dom</a>, or to see a certain Google presentation and the <a href="http://twitter.com/schlunzi">attendant security</a>- this year... and therefore missing the lovely <a href="http://swedishbeers.blogspot.com/2009/02/swedish-beers-are-go.html">Swedish Beers </a>which Helen is organising on Wednesday 18th.</p>

<p>The last one I made it to (in 2006 I think) was up to the usual standards - i.e. an unhealthy percentage of the mobile content and apps world in a single room, loosening their inhibitions most pleasantly :) Gutted to be missing it again...</p>
