<p>We've just had some rather good news - and a fringe benefit of this is that I can share my favourite photos[<a href="#photo2">1</a>] of 2008 with you:</p>

<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/3276568098/" title="Falletti &amp; Hume storming Redmond by twhume, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3419/3276568098_8e84d98d49_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Falletti &amp; Hume storming Redmond" /></a></div>

<p><a href="http://sergiofalletti.typepad.com/">Mr Falletti</a> and I took a top-secret 1-day trip to Seattle last December to present <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">Future Platforms</a> to Microsoft and put us forward for a very interesting piece of work. These things usually take time to bear fruit, but I can now reveal that we've won the job. It would be a chronic understatement to say we're all tremendously excited that the world's largest software company chose us over the competition.</p>

<p>My lips are tightly (and rightly) sealed when it comes to talking about what we're doing, and in fact you won't be hearing a great deal from me in the immediate future; we're collocating our team with MS for the start of the project, so we'll all be out of the country for a little while. I'll be able to talk a lot more about what we're up to in due course, though.</p>

<p>The one downside of this is that I get to miss <a href="http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/">Mobile World Congress</a> (again), and <a href="http://www.liftconference.com/">LIFT</a> (which I was really looking forward to). But hey - we're a service agency, and with the UK heading into recession it seems churlish in the extreme to complain about winning a large piece of interesting work from a high-profile new customer :) </p>
