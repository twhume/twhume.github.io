<li> Using <a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/xpmag/BigVisibleCharts.htm">Big Visible Charts</a> from Ron Jeffries: "<i>Here's the real power of a chart. It goes along peacefully, minding its own business, tracking events. Then, when a pattern of events looks bad, the chart shows it, and triggers people to come together and solve the problem</i>"
<li> <a href="http://www.visionmobile.com/blog/2009/01/ui-personalities-a-new-premium-content-market-on-the-radar/">UI personalities</a>, an interesting post from Andreas Constantinou. I think we'll see more of this stuff happening, particularly as handset designers <a href="http://conversations.nokia.com/2009/03/09/featuring-mat-bickley-a-design-manager-within-nokia-design/">focus more on the internals</a>. If we're to rely on the middle layers Andreas talks about, I'd agree with him on 2010 being a date by which we'll start seeing this stuff... but there's a lot that can be done now;
<li> <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/mobile-usability.html">Jakob Nielsen</a> got his mobile on: "<i>Sites (including intranets) must develop specialized designs that optimize the mobile user experience. Today, few sites have mobile versions, and those that do are usually very poorly designed, without knowledge of the special guidelines for mobile usability</i>";
<li> <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/03/13/emcc_tits_up/">RIP EMCC</a> :(
<li> Nice interview with Alan Cooper on the <a href="http://www.infoq.com/interviews/Interaction-Design-Alan-Cooper;jsessionid=444207C9CF4244422BA8738702B2E28A">similarities between Interaction Designers and Agile Programmers</a>;

<li> Doodle <a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com/2009/03/03/doodle-is-a-doddle-for-group-events/">launched an API</a>. Doodle is a lovely, focused, simple web service I use all the time.
<li> <a href="http://www.rallydev.com/agileblog/2009/03/how-do-you-plan-for-unplanned-work-part-3/">How do you plan for unplanned work</a>? This has been a big one for us over the last year - we maintain quite a few services and need to be able to react quickly to problems;
<li> <a href="http://siftables.com/">Siftables</a>: "<i>cookie-sized computers with motion sensing, neighbor detection, graphical display, and wireless communication. They act in concert to form a single interface: users physically manipulate them - piling, grouping, sorting - to interact with digital information and media. Siftables provides a new platform on which to implement tangible, visual and mobile applicationsn</i>". Lovely in and of themselves, but a wonderful display of imaginative uses of simple tech too.
<li> Nat Pryce <a href="http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000756.html">on the Dunning-Kruger Effect</a>: "<i>Have you noticed that you grumble (even if only to yourself) about code quality when you join a project and want to change stuff to improve it? And have you noticed that those improvements are seldom as easy to make as first thought and, once started, are often never completed successfully?</i>"
<li> Mike Cohn on <a href="http://blog.mountaingoatsoftware.com/how-do-story-points-relate-to-hours">the relationship between story points and hours</a>. I have an as-yet-unsatisfied urge to move us from hours to story points for our long-term planning...
