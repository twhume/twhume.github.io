<p>We're just putting together a newsletter for FP, and looking through it, I've realised I'm doing a bit of speaking over the next few months. So if you fancy catching up, I'll be:</p>

<ul>
<li> Doing a short skit on "Knocking Down Walls" at <a href="http://mobiledesign.org.uk/events/april-22nd-2009-event-seren/">MobileDesign</a> in London on 22nd April. Getting designers and developers working well together - particularly in an "Agile" environment - is a Really Big Deal to me. I'll be talking about a few of the things we've learned over the years. 
<li> Then on 3rd and 4th June I'll be up at the <a href="http://www.mobilewebsummit.com/">Mobile Web Summit</a>, also in London. My talk is titled "Mobile Media 2.0 - a 2 way channel, leveraging the benefits of enhanced communication with your audience", which I think is a very posh way of saying that I'll be talking about why mobile is good for conversations more than broadcasting stuff. Hopefully I'll manage to come out with some observations which aren't *quite* that obvious ;) 
<li> Update: how could I forget? I'm not speaking there, but really looking forward to <a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com/2009/03/20/geek-n-rolla-tech-startups-rock-april-21-london/">Geek'n'Rolla</a> on April 21st. It'll be a good opportunity to take the pulse of the UK startup scene...
</ul>

<p>I'm also keeping my fingers crossed about a submission I've co-authored for a certain Large Agile conference, but more on that when I hear back from the organisers...</p>
