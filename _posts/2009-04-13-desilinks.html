<li> <a href="http://www.designobserver.com/archives/entry.html?id=39207">10 graphic design paradoxes</a> - though I can't see anything here which only applies to graphic design, all good stuff
<li> <a href="http://stevenf.tumblr.com/post/94591835/warning-a-long-rambly-exploration-of-the-state">dominant UI metaphors and how we might escape them</a>: "<i>It seems a bit fatalistic, but I can’t think of a way that the entire desktop metaphor can be overhauled without either everyone in the world switching over at once (which won’t happen), or becoming a “data island” like the Newton or Classic Mac OS.</i>". I've just read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Geeks-Bearing-Gifts-Ted-Nelson/dp/0578004380/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1239658993&sr=8-1">Geeks Bearing Gifts</a> by Ted Nelson, who's wonderfully annoyed at the universal adoption of UIs from Xerox PARC: more metaphors, now!
