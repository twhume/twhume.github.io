<ul>
<li> The Guardian <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/apr/12/iphone-applications-music-industry">runs a piece of iPhone apps</a>, sensibly pointing out that not everyone developing apps is a millionaire just yet.
<li> That said, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-sells-1-billion-iphone-apps-three-times-faster-than-it-sold-1-billion-itunes-songs-2009-4">apps seems to be selling faster than songs did</a>: "<i>It took Apple more than two years to sell 1 billion songs on iTunes, so it's going to hit 1 billion apps about three times faster.</i>"
<li> Lovely if frightening piece on the Register about <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/10/mobile_phone_tracking">the mobile as self-inflicted surveillance</a>: "<i>There are already two documented cases in Europe where not carrying a mobile phone was considered one of the grounds for arrest</i>"
<li> The <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/09/g20_vids/">panopticon ain't all bad</a>, depending on who's doing the watching;
<li> Some <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/09/ichat_video_messaging/">fairly obvious video chat patents</a> for the iPhone;
<li> <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/09/us_mobile_company_requirements/">US mobile carriers want fewer OSs</a>, film at 11, though why any carrier wants to get involved with supplying "a unified development environment" to provide cross-device consistency is beyond me. Developer support is probably the one thing operators have been worse at than being media companies (with a few exceptions I won't go into now, so everyone I know at operators thinks I'm talking about them).
<li> Sulake are <a href="http://www.arcticstartup.com/2009/04/07/sulake-opens-mobile-virtual-world-bobba/">doing a mobile virtual world</a>, and about time too.
<li> Nokia have <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/16/ovi_store/">launched the Ovi store</a>, though please god don't let them use "location sensing and social networks" to start recommending applications.
<li> <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/02/android-market-update-support-for.html">Android went priced</a>, and about time too. We've had surprisingly high download figures for some simple Android apps - hmm, I need to write a piece about that....
