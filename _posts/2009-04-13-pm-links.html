<li> <A href="http://blog.mountaingoatsoftware.com/why-do-release-planning">Why do release planning</a>? "<i>A release plan helps a team avoid finishing a series of sprints and feeling that, while they always worked on the highest priority items, the collection of work completed does not add up to a satisfying whole.</i>"
<li> <a href="http://startuplessonslearned.blogspot.com/2009/04/built-to-learn.html">Built to Learn</a>: "<i>No marketing team. No engineering team. You need a problem team and a solution team.</i>"
<li> I'm really enjoying reading Steve Blank at the moment, particularly his war stories of <a href="http://steveblank.com/2009/04/02/supermac-war-story-5-strategy-versus-relentless-tactical-execution-%e2%80%94-the-potrero-benchmarks/">understanding the customers</a> and <a href="http://steveblank.com/2009/04/09/supermac-war-story-6-the-job-of-marketing-mission-statements-mission-intent-and-core-values/">building the marketing department</a> of a US startup in the early 80s.
<li> <a href="http://leansoftwareengineering.com/2009/04/07/feature-crews/">Large-scale software engineering and kanban</a>, touching on branching-by-feature, something we're gradually leaning (ho ho) towards at FP...

Fail fast has long been a motto of XP teams, but perhaps we’ve forgotten how it can relate to our build.</i>"
<li> <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/articles/ladder.html">The Fog Creek Professional Ladder</a>; I plotted us on this, and was pleasantly surprised to see we have - broadly, but not exactly, and certainly more by luck than judgement so far - achieved a similar mapping.
<li> <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">The Pomorodo Technique</a> for personal time management. I tried this today, and will be continuing it throughout the week to see if it makes any difference. Nike+ proved to me that monitoring my own behaviour modifies it (for the better, in that case). Let's see...
<li> <a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/xpmag/jatBaseball.htm">We tried baseball, and it didn't work</a>. Heh.
<li> <a href="http://venturehacks.com/articles/five-whys">Five whys</a>. NEVER USE THIS IN PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS.
