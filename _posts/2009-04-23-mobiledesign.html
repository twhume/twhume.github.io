<p><a href="http://mobiledesign.org.uk/">MobileDesign</a> was pretty darn good this evening. It was the first time I'd been - which I now regret even more - and with an excellent crowd (familiar and new faces), lovely venue, and good speakers (ahem) I was most impressed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/3467080992/" title="Steal This Interaction Pattern by twhume, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3521/3467080992_54180ea0c2_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Steal This Interaction Pattern" align="right" hspace="10"/></a>I particularly enjoyed <a href="http://www.nedrichards.com/">Nick Richards</a>' talk on the work he did at <a href="http://www.fjord.co.uk/">Fjord</a> on the BBC iPlayer. Nick exhorted us to steal all we could from Auntie, and I came away with a few notes of interesting stuff:</p>

<ul>
<li> They designed for 5-way navigation (up/down/left/right/fire), not 3-way (up/down/fire); horizontal navigation allowed them to increase the density of information on-screen - a key goal of the project;
<li> Repetition of imagery between its selection (in navigation) and presentation further down, to reassure users they'd made the right choice;
<li> "Light personalisation" through areas of the screen which expand on clicking, and whose state is remembered;
<li> The importance of "resume" functionality when your user sessions are typically 15m long and programmes average 30m;
<li> Targeting specific high-end devices only;
<li> Use of click-to-send smsto:// URLs and iCal format events to save into the on-phone calendar;
<li> Thinking carefully about what happens when constraints loosen - e.g. when those 900 hours of content increase to 9000 in future;
<li> Implementing pages as sequences of modules, each of which had a fall-back "low-end" version, instead of having a "hi" and "lo" version of the site as a whole;
<li> Weekly iterations with user testing every week, and how lovely the BBC are to work with;
<li> Full customisation didn't make it in to launch;
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/3466264897/" title="MobileDesign: your host by twhume, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3619/3466264897_a81493c235_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="MobileDesign: your host" align="left" hspace="10" /></a>I did the following talk on "knocking down walls between designers and developers". I wasn't happy either with my delivery or the overall content; I felt it should've been less of the "designers and developers should just hug each other"-fest it felt like at times - a truism I don't see much point in repeating; that I should've drawn on more specific experiences we'd had at FP (we're not short of them!) rather than making general sweeping statements; and I shouldn't do a talk when I'm half-asleep after a planning day... slides are <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/twh/lol-mobile-design">here</a>, anyhow, if you want to see some kitty photos.</p>

<p>The UsTwo guys gave a very nicely-done presentation about personalisation and future UX, which I really enjoyed despite dozing off within - would love to see it again.</p>

<p>Thanks to the <a href="http://www.yiibu.com/">Yiibus</a> for all their efforts in bringing this together, and to <a href="http://www.seren.uk.com/">Seren</a> for having such a wonderful office :)</p>
