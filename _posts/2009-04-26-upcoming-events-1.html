<p>It feels like I've only just written on this topic, but I've heard about a couple more events I'll be speaking at over the coming months:</p>

<ul>
<li> I'm triple-chuffed that the workshop Joh and I proposed for the UX track of <a href="http://agile2009.agilealliance.org/">Agile2009</a> in Chicago has been accepted: "<a href="http://agile2009.agilealliance.org/node/2562">Many Paths To The Top Of The (Mobile) Mountain</a>" will be an exploration of the constraints of mobile as they relate to UX in an agile environment. We're hoping to do a dry run of this session at some point in Brighton before we head off to the USA for the real deal too...
<li> Before then, I'll be at <a href="http://mobile20.eu/">Mobile 2.0 Europe</a> in Barcelona, as part of the Play strand of the event. I'm not 100% sure what I'll be talking about - perhaps looking back at case studies of successful gaming services, or our adventures with Android and casual games.
<li> And more pressingly, I'll be presenting at the <a href="http://www.mobilewebsummit.com/">Mobile Web 2.0 summit</a> in London, on the two-way-ness of mobile media as a channel. A whisper in my ear reminds me the early-bird discount runs out today, so if you're not a developer or startup (who get in cheap whatever the weather), best hurry...
<li>

<p>All this and <a href="http://bogfest.org.uk/">BOGFest</a> too :)</p>
