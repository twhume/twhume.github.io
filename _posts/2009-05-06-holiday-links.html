<p>I'm technically on holiday this week, but some links anyhow:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.agileproductdesign.com/blog/2009/kanban_over_simplified.html">Jeff Patton on kanban</a>. Really interesting,  (a) because it's Jeff and (b) for the content, and I loved Karl's talk on this stuff at the Skiff a few weeks back. I profess quiet caution though; having seen how many folks misapply the relatively disciplined approaches of more formal agile techniques, I fear the line "yeah, we're kanban because we stuck some cards to the wall"...
<li> Wonderfully put <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/apr2009/id20090429_083139.htm">call for a group hug</a> from Bill Buxton to the engineering and design communities. I particularly like the specifics he goes into here: how design awareness, literacy and even thinking can, with effort, be adopted by anyone... and how design practice requires professionals "<em>who have invested just as much to acquire their set of skills as the computer scientists have put in for theirs</em>". +1, +1, +1.
<li> <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SmutOnRails.html">SmutOnRails</a>, Martin Fowler on the recent CouchDB presentation that caused a stir: "<i>My observation is that most men in the software business think that there isn't much sexism left in the profession - that this curse is a memory from a previous generation. Yet when I talk to women, I hear a different story</i>". Interesting, particularly in light of the Geek'n'rolla debate where this view of the software/digital/IT industry was confirmed (by both men and women IIRC). Lots of further reading at the foot of Martin's article.
<li> VCs are <a href="http://www.moconews.net/entry/419-venture-capitalists-not-so-convinced-100-million-mobile-app-companies-e/">struggling to see the sort of returns they want in a mobile apps business</a>. Whilst obviously <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">on one level</a> I find this a shockingly short-sighted yadda yadda yadda, another part of me breathes a sigh of relief. App stores are a fantastic economy, but no guarantee of riches, and we tend to hear about <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/flight-control-iphone-app-maker-discloses-interesting-sales-data-2009-4">the few successes</a> well over and above the mediocre mass.
<li> Steve Blank continues to deliver some <a href="http://steveblank.com/2009/04/30/1605/">amazingly</a> insightful posts, and "Four steps to the epiphany" will, I suspect, be re-read a few times this year.
<li> For fans of contention and BlogWar, "<a href="http://www.cooper.com/journal/2009/04/is_ixd_a_dead_end_job.html">Is Interaction Design a Dead-End Job</a>" asks none other than Bill Moggridge. More optimistically, Tim @ Cooper suggests that "<i>the acknowledgment and appreciation of good interaction design has allowed the practice to evolve to include a broader mandate encompassing product and service strategy throughout the customer relationship lifecycle</i>". 
<li> Vodafone hint that future Android devices might be <a href="http://www.moconews.net/entry/419-android-bits-motorolas-first-handset-coming-to-verizon-vodafone-plannin/">less Googly and more Vodafoney</a>. /me whistles innocently, stares into space, quietly lusts after HTC Magic.
<li><a href="http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2009/04/iterative-webapp-gmail-for-mobile-gets.html"> GMail for Mobile got the "mute" feature</a>, which I'd never heard of but am frantically using. Oh yes - I may have forgotten to mention that I'm now using GMail in the browser for *all* my email needs... I've fallen hard for the 'plex in the last few months.
<li> <a href="http://www.moconews.net/entry/419-report-greystripe-says-iphone-apps-have-an-average-shelf-life-of-20-ses/">Interesting iPhone stats</a> from GreyStripe: average app gets 20 sessions usage of 10 minutes apiece. I wonder how this, combined with the typical development cost of an iPhone app, compares in cost-of-attention that other forms of advertising or promotion might garner. Help me, lazyweb...
<li> <a href="http://graphjam.com/">GraphJam</a> is my new favourite best thing in the internet ever.
<li> <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/t-mobile-confirms-1-million-google-android-phones-sold-2009-4">T-Mobile sold 1 million G1s</a> - not bad going for a first-generation device with every conceivable input mechanism and a spangly new OS that *isn't* being marketed by Apple. But let's not pretend that the success of Android is predicated on the sales of any 1, or even N devices, eh?
<li> Whilst we're on big numbers, <a href="http://mobhappy.com/blog1/2009/04/24/1-billion-apps/">1 billion iPhone downloads</a>, eh? I put this down more to Longino's Revised Statute than Buckley's Law in this case (tho Buckley definitely applies elsewhere): the sheer ease of trying stuff out on the iPhone is what's had me (and others I've had the pleasure of observing close-hand) installing apps. When all I lose by downloading a new piece of software is a little boredom, I'll do it again and again...
</ul>
