<li> <a href="http://agilesoftwaredevelopment.com/blog/peterstev/10-agile-contracts">10 contracts for your next agile project</a>; I really want us to play with the cringe-worthily named but interesting "<a href="http://jeffsutherland.com/scrum/2008/08/agile-2008-money-for-nothing.html">money for nothing, change for free</a>" model Jeff has written about.
