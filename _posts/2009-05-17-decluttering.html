<p>Foliage has sprung up across Firefox. I burn it here:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.techflash.com/venture/Ten_lessons_in_bootstrapping_from_the_founders_of_Urbanspoon_44968952.html">10 lessons in bootstrapping</a> from the founders of UrbanSpoon;
<li> <a href="http://www.viapost.com/">ViaPost</a> looks interesting: redefining the whole of the postal service as "<em>the thing that sits behind a printer driver</em>" tickles and terrifies me equally;
<li> <a href="http://benjaminmitchell.blogspot.com/2009/05/control-capability-charts-on-kanban.html">Control/capability charts on Kanban</a>: interesting, I think, though I'm finding that for me personally the challenge is not in gathering and visualising data, but in working out what to do with it;
<li> <a href="http://www.kickerstudio.com/blog/2009/05/six-questions-from-kicker-jack-schulze/">Six questions with Jack Schulze</a>, who I suspect is so Ri it hurts. It feels a bit hypocritical to blog it, but I found myself nodding furiously to his advice that "<i>talking about your work does not directly improve the actual quality of your work</i>";
<li> <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/conferences/tgc_2009/6021-TGC-2009-How-a-Board-Game-Can-Make-You-Cry">Harrowing board games</a>;
<li> Karl on <a href="http://availagility.wordpress.com/2008/10/28/kanban-flow-and-cadence/">Kanban, flow and cadence</a>;
<li> <a href="http://idlemode.com/2009/05/08/iphone-home-screen-still-cant-scale/">The iPhone home screen can't scale</a>, apparently. Personally I suspect that uptake of applications on this device has something to do with the fact that they're *not* hidden at the bottom of a folder hierarchy - and if users are anything like me, they sometimes disable or delete apps they've once purchased, so the assertion that they need to easily navigate 40+ is balls. Flat home screen is a feature, not bug, IMHO;
<li> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1eqNkhh0eI">Transitions on Nokia</a>, if nothing else a nice guide to where and how to use these wee beasties;
<li> <a href="http://www.miltonglaser.com/pages/milton/essays/es3.html">10 things I have learned</a> by Milton Glaser. Number 1 seems to have unpleasant implications for me;
<li> <a href="http://bigtweet.com/c/b/twitter/antonmannering/fpm5w">Why text messages are limited to 160 characters</a> - a bit o'history;
</ul>
