<p><strong>MEX: Achieving great tactile experience is a subtle art, Christophe Ramstein, CTO <a href="http://www.immersion.com/">Immersion</a></strong></p>

<p>Gets us to take one anothers' pulse.</p>

<p>As person taking the pulse, you were able to perceive something invisible and engage on another level. Haptics is an invisible experience we're trying to bring to the computer.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/3546125018/" title="Tactile Feedback Improves Performance by twhume, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3565/3546125018_a326bfa565_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Tactile Feedback Improves Performance" align="left" hspace="10" /></a><strong>What is it?</strong></p>

<p>Cutaneous sensors - skin is 2 square metres! Kinesethesia (positioning of body parts). Proprioception (integration of sensing with self-awareness?).</p>

<p>You can't feel if you don't touch - it requires proximity and contact. Haptics is intimately related to motor control. Touch reinforces sight and sound and needs to be consistent with them. "Touching is believing".</p>

<p><strong>Hardware vs digital?</strong></p>

<p>We have new types of UI enabled by haptics, and enhanced UX. And it might be realistic (simulation-based) or interactive.</p>

<p><strong>How does it enhance UX?</strong></p>

<p>Pros: direct/natural manipulation, maximise ergonomics by combining output and input, reconfigurable UI. </p>

<p>Cons: typing, visual occlusion, lag, sensing thresholds. Mechanical keyboards are still better.</p>

<p>Samsung and LG have quickly replaced their UI with touchscreens, and are now moving to haptics.</p>

<p><strong>How can we leverage it?</strong></p>

<p>Touchscreen navigation/typing is a big problem. Tangible messaging and communication is an opportunity. Things become emotional when we touch them. What if we could hug remotely (ahem - you can - <a href="http://www.cutecircuit.com/">CuteCircuit</a>). Non-verbal communication.</p>

<p>Haptics improves typical WPM and accuracy, "except when you're sitting on a Jackhammer".</p>

<p>You can type on a mechanical keyboard without looking at it. There's a rumour that some car UI will be forced (by regulation) to have haptic feedback to make it safer.</p>

<p><strong>What are the design guidelines?</strong></p>

<p>Design tools for haptics: synchronise with sounds, shape parameters (amplitude, frequency, etc.), design effects and experience in real-time. Today we're talking about "button confirmation".</p>

<p>Q: We know haptics is important, but there are so few tools to experiment with it... how can designers begin to prototype?<br><br />
A: Look at the ones <a href="http://www.immersion.com/">on our web site</a>.</p>

<p>Q: How do you see gestures combined with haptics?<br><br />
A: It's about enaction. There's lots of room for gestures, for creating or manipulating content. How do you get the perception that what you did was accepted. (Knocks on table). This is a gesture, the sound, vision and feel gives feedback.</p>

<p>Marek: when you engage with people on an emotion level, you connect with them more deeply. Does this make them more likely to spend?</p>
