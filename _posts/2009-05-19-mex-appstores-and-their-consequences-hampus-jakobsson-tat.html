<p><strong>MEX: Appstores and their consequences, Hampus Jakobsson, TAT</strong></p>

<p>TAT: licenses UI software, does inspirational design. Kit ships on 10% of all devices 2008. 140 people, Sweden, US, Korea.</p>

<p>Apple and Palm are arriving and doing impressive things - this is frustrating for incumbents, but empowering.</p>

<p>How could it be improved?</p>

<ul>
<li>Context: location, time could be used to funnel users towards appropriate applications. 
<li>Discovery is like Digg - the top apps get loads of traffic, it's hard for others to break in.
<li>No try before you buy.
<li>No tell-a-friend.
<li>No recommendations or discussions.
<li>Less uber-control by one player would help. How about co-branded stores (the MEX store)? There's no transparency.
<li>Categories should be premium ($4.99+), standard ($0-4.99) and free.
<li>Get What's Hot from derivatives.
<li>Measure and rate by value = price times volume
<li>Sort on ratings not volume
<li>Add 25% with few ratings to improve discovery of new apps.
<li>Why not friend-to-friend sales?
</ul>

<p>App stores will be just the start of advanced personalisation. When Apple released their phone there was no app store - the first ones were hacked-in.</p>

<p>History of personalisation: started out with contacts and SMS, then pictures/videos/music, now apps and bookmarks. Phones have infinite uses once you add applications.</p>

<p>We have to make the UI more dynamic (cough, says vendor of dynamic UI solutions). Apparently UI should be experience based and match the real world, anticipate your needs, etc.</p>

<p>Mobile phones "steal us from one another" in their attention-grabbing.</p>

<p>A lot of Apples innovation was around the payment experience, and is amazing.<br />
