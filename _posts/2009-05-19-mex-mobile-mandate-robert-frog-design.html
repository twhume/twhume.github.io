<p><strong>MEX: Mobile Mandate, Robert, Frog Design</strong></p>

<p>We've been collectively frustrated by the gap between aspirations and reality. What are the most meaningful things that we can touch with the device - areas like healthcare, education?</p>

<p>Robert tells a story about Zinny (sp?) - AIDS sufferer admitted to hospital, one of the first few to be put on an ARV programmer who recovered. She started an organisation with a Harvard-trained doctor to run a treatment and education programme in S. Africa.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/3545317809/" title="Frog Man by twhume, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2430/3545317809_58bcecd569_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Frog Man" hspace="10" align="right" /></a>Talks about ARV projects which are complex to manage - information and help is needed to manage tests and treatment, and they're falling behind. Most people come in for tests when they're already in a poor condition: low survival rate, difficulty in completing any ARV programme.</p>

<p>The system right now doesn't work for them. They need to reach more people - not the 120k folks they're working with now, but the 40% of the population of the local area at risk.</p>

<p>They get leverage through mobile technologies. How can they use mobile to reach out, get people to test, and encourage them to stick with treatment?</p>

<p>Launched 2008 with a mobile outreach campaign. 80-90% of S.Africa have access to a mobile, 90% prepay. They have an SMS-like service, 6 free messages/day when you run out of minutes that let you send a v short message for a phone number: the message being "please call me". There's a bit of spare space in these messages. They got the second-largest operator to donate 5% of its inventory of this space (priced at $250,000 p.a. - not bad for reaching a million people a day). That's a million messages containing worthwhile AIDS/HIV information, "the worlds biggest field trial of mobile health technology". </p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>This is the *only* way to reach these people. Next step: testing and ongoing support.</p>

<p>There's a huge revolution in low-cost diagnostics. The kits are routinely stolen and cost $18 apiece - there's a huge demand for them.</p>

<p>Mobile is not one channel, it's many. What about voicemail - 90s of audio delivered into mailboxes for free, e.g. a message from Nelson Mandela encouraging them to test. You need a model that brings these today (this sounds like the "seams" topic we covered at Future of Mobile last year).</p>

<p>Instructions on the kits are paired with numbers you can call for support at each step. How do we keep people aware throughout? With various calls to action. A local record label had its stars endorse and get tested at the hospital - ensuring this was seen as a locally supported campaign. They user-tested instructions on young men getting HIV tested for the first time.</p>

<p>Frogs US clients are desperately interested in this too - getting people to actively engage with healthcare.</p>

<p>What's missing? Good design. People need feedback. It's not about haptic feedback and rich media. We need partnerships - with Nokia, Nike, anyone with vested interests in these markets.</p>

<p>Frog is committing to one catalyst project per year in mobile health. Currently considering: depression/mood support, social willpower, counterfeit drugs.</p>
