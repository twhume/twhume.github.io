<p>I forgot to post about <a href="http://bogfest.org.uk/">BOGFest</a> - Brighton Outdoor Gaming Festival, the inaugural event of which was held last weekend in Brunswick Square - curated by Richard Vahrman of <a href="http://www.locomatrix.co.uk/">Locomatrix</a> fame.</p>

<p>There was a programme of events running all afternoon; after a diary clash with a 5th birthday party, I managed to make it along at 4, missing Tai Chi Twister and Clock the Doc but arriving just in time to kick off some games of Fruit Farmer, one of the Locomatrix formats.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/3556558253/" title="Skies Darken as FP Arrive by twhume, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2429/3556558253_373e2712df_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Skies Darken as FP Arrive" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5"/></a>It was really interesting seeing Real People playing Fruit Farmer. We cheated completely, of course, and presented each player with a phone and GPS unit that had been preconfigured with the application installed - in real life they'd have to do this themselves, which we know to be a bit of a barrier (though the geocaching crowd seem to use applications on occasion, so it's not completely out of the question).</p>

<p>We had 6 pairs of players run off for a game. All bar one of the pairs managed to locate themselves quickly and orient themselves against the on-screen map - working out what direction they had to run in to do anything useful. A few players noted that their position was a little laggy, and we were slightly embarrassed to find out that the game layout we'd chosen for the day was slightly too large for the playing area - meaning that players would've had to climb onto the roofs of local buildings to collect a few of the larger pieces of fruit. Memo to self: next time, check map first.</p>

<p>But that said, players seemed to enjoy the game - particularly some of our younger participants:</p>

<p>Also throughout the day we had some treasure hunts running, a scavenger hunt at the end of the day, and Tristan brought along his Hunt the Wumpus QR-code game - he's written a great post on how it went for him, which you can find <a href="http://blog.cogapp.com/2009/05/28/wumpus-goes-to-bogfest/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Time constraints meant that I never got to show off ArchaeoloGPS, the game I've been doodling with recently. Perhaps next year... :)<br />
