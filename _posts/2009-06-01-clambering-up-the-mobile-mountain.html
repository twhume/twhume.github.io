<p>If you're in Brighton and interested in this sort of thing, <a href="http://www.eventyr.co.uk/">Joh</a> and I will be running a dress rehearsal for the <a href="http://agile2009.agilealliance.org/node/2562">workshop</a> we've running at <a href="http://agile2009.agilealliance.org/">Agile2009</a> in Chicago this August. It'll be held at <a href="http://theskiff.org/">The Mighty Skiff</a> on Monday 13th July, 7:30pm onwards. The theme for the workshop is exploration of constraints within an iterative design process. That's a posh way of saying that we're going to get you designing stuff for phones in 90 minutes, and look at how how form factors affect what you make.</p>

<p>Expect measured quantities of chaos: we've not run this format before, and one reason for doing a dress rehearsal is to iron out the kinks and, guess what: note what works, what doesn't, and what we don't yet understand.</p>

<p>Despite the daunting quantity of work remaining to prep, I'm really looking forward to it. And <a href="http://dudleyhume.co.uk/">a friendly carpenter</a> I happen to know is already busy churning out some of the props for the evening:</p>
