<p>I've put the slides from my talk at <a href="http://www.mobilewebsummit.com/">Mobile Web Summit 2.0</a> online - they're <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/twh/making-people-happy-for-fun-and-profit">here</a>, if you're after them.</p>

<p>My talk was looking at case studies of three mobile apps, two of which we'd done (Puzzler and the Ghost Detector), and one being the mighty <a href="http://www.smule.com/">Smule</a> (which I've <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2009/02/delightful-maps-and-location-based-gravy.html">written about before</a>). The main point I was making is that - as I was chuffed to hear <a href="http://www.torgo.com/blog/">Dan</a> mention in his opening talk on day two - "<i>all interesting mobile apps have some sort of social element</i>". That said, this  needn't involve all the classic paraphernalia of "social media" - i.e. conversations, contact management, or identity - and assuming that to be doing something social, you have to be building a branded Facebook, or a blogging platform, seems a little... crude. Audiences can be connected in more subtle ways, and as the examples of the league tables we launched for Puzzler, and the opt-in rate for Ghosty both show, these can lead to measurable increases in both uptake and loyalty.</p>

<p>We had fun in the panel session afterwards too, where I got to trot out a theory I've been nurturing around mobile advertising: on the web, the aim of advertising has been to drive users to useful web services, where they can get something useful done. On mobile, applications are a more appropriate destination for advertising.</p>

<p>Why? Mobile web sites tend to be more limited. There are a few really "sticky" ones (<a href="http://www.itsmy.com/">itsMy</a> and <a href="http://www.flirtomatic.com/">Flirtomatic</a>, I'm looking at you), but most destinations for mobile advertising are ad-supporting microsites with little long-term value for a visitor. As such,  applications are a more natural and worthwhile destination for mobile advertising: give your prospective customers something genuinely useful they can carry with themselves and see value from again and again, rather than expecting them to return to a microsite.</p>

<p>If you're sceptical, I'd encourage you to look at <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/02/19/pinch-media-data-shows-the-average-shelf-life-of-an-iphone-app-is-less-than-30-days/">iPhone app store statistics</a> - the average free app is being run 80 times. This might not mean it's a great place to run advertising, but I'll wager that's roughly 80 times more traffic than most mobile microsites get...</p>
