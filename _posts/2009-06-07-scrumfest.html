<p><a href="http://www.scrumfest.org">ScrumFest</a> is coming to Brighton! 8th and 9th July, at The Werks in Hove. Well worth checking out if you're interested in this sort of thing, also take a look at the <a href="http://agilethinking.net/welfareCSM/workshops.html">WelfareCSM workshops</a> Tobias Mayer is running just beforehand, with the dual aims of introducing Scrum to organisations beyond the software world, and getting training to folks who wouldn't otherwise be able to afford it. Lovely.</p>
