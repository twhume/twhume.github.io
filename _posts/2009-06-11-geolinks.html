<p>For several completely unrelated reasons, I've spent a lot of time looking at and thinking about maps this week.</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.geonames.org">GeoNames</a>, a database of places (as used by <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/">Dopplr</a>)
<li> Vodafone have a cute map, Twitter-driven (obviously) of <a href="http://www.ukholsmap.com/">who's going on holiday where, this summer;</a>
<li> A <a href="http://www.opengeodata.org/?p=552">mind-expanding article</a> on augmenting photographic data, courtesy of pitch/yaw/roll, GPS and OpenStreetmap;
<li> <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?824">First person UIs</a> - who'da thunk that a simple compass opens up so many possibilities? I note that whilst JSR179 has included compass support in the location APIs, compasses were the bit that most implementations of the standard failed to include for a long time...
<li> The <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/staticmaps/">Google static maps API</a> - handy when you're targeting platforms that don't let you do all the usual Googly JavaScript stuff;
</ul>
