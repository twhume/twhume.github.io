<li> Nice <a href="http://www.agiledevelopmentwithrob.com//blog/agile-videos/344/mike-cohn-talks-with-robert-dempsey-about-agile-and-scrum/">video interview with Mike Cohn</a>, including some lovely advice on how to start getting your Scrum on. I'd thoroughly concur - try it and do it strictly for a reasonable period of time before you start to adapt it;
<li> I'm sure I'll have posted this before, but it's worth repeating - Jeff Patton's <a href="http://www.uie.com/articles/best_practices/">12 best practices for UX in an agile environment</a>;
<li> <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/05/google-bets-big-on-html-5.html">Google Bets On Big 5</a> - old news as this dates back to last month, but I'm reviewing it after watching the Google IO Keynote video. Very interesting indeed, but I'd take issue with their presenting this technology as "all there" - a few experiments on Firefox, Safari and Chrome on the mac seem to show that some bits are present and correct on each, others lacking. Still, very exciting stuff whatever...
<li> <a href="http://wave.google.com/">Wave</a>. Wow, double-wow for the demo of live translation at the end.
<li> A <a href="http://www.frontend.com/products-digital-devices/real-or-imaginary-the-effectiveness-of-using-personas-in-product-design.html#Methodology">study on the effectiveness of using personas</a> in product design. Really nice to have some evidence for this stuff, though the study involved giving participants pre-prepared personas. My take would be that personas are a useful tool when based on research, but as a catalysed form of assumptions about a target audience, they can be dangerous.
<li> Another study, on how <a href="http://media.caltech.edu/press_releases/13091">price affects perception</a>.
<li> Interesting presentation on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/helenmilner/helen-milner-digital-inclusion-the-evidence-april-2009-national-digital-inclusion-conference-london#stats-bottom">digital inclusion in the UK</a>, and preconceptions we may have.
