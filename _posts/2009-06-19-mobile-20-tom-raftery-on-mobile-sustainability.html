<p><strong>Mobile 2.0: Tom Raftery on Mobile Sustainability</strong></p>

<p>greenmonk.net</p>

<p>Drivers for sustainability: climate change (we're all fucked) and the business case (sustainable companies tend to outperform their competitors).</p>

<p>ICT could reduce 15% CO2 emissions globally: through 1bn PCs, 1.2bn landlines, 1.4bn internet users, 4bn mobile users. So mobile is the target for this stuff.</p>

<p>Handset manufacturers are doing sod all: they all have "a green phone".</p>

<p>Many carriers don't mention sustainability initiatives: O2 have a reasonable site, Telefonica and 3 don't.</p>

<p>What are developers doing? Clearstandards have an iPhone app to calculate carbon footprint. 3rdWhale, MobiMonster also get a mention - the latter reduces energy usage of phone. But nothing really significant.</p>

<p>What if:</p>

<ul>
<li> Manufacturers made phones to last 6y not 6m? 60% of a phones carbon footprint comes from manufacture. Rent phones, don't buy them.
<li> Phones were made from biodegradables?
<li> USB chargers were standard?
<li> Operators switched to e-billing?
<li> Operators shared networks?
<li> Developers used mobile platform to build apps which mae a difference?
<li> Grid computing client apps were made for mobiles?
</ul>

<p>I wonder... How does mobile compare to PC - are phones implicitly more energy-conservative? And what specifically can developers do?</p>
