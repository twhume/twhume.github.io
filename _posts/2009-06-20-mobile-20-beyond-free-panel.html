<p><strong>Mobile 2.0: Beyond Free, Panel</strong></p>

<p>IM: It's hard to fund mobile-specific busines</p>

<p>IM: What digital goods are being sold for a decent price?<br><br />
PP: It depends on context. What goods are being sold on ebay?</p>

<p>PP: There's a distinction between creating an application and a service. In the song analogy, it's like being a creative musician. Anyone know of any apps which are service-like?</p>

<p>IM: There's a company in Madrid who does betting on mobile goods. They auction cars, games consoles, by text message: you bid for the ident, lowest price. </p>

<p>IM: What are the services worth paying for?<br />
FB: Infrastructure companies like Orbster ("infrastructure on the phone").</p>

<p>IM: Imagine your service complementing others, so the uptake of users is faster. What elements are worth paying for? PP stresses UI...<br />
PP: It's not just about the UI, that's where we're going wrong. UI can be lipstick on a pig. It's the whole ecosystem, there's as much design in the business model as in the presentation layer.</p>

<p>FB: To push a service through the operator organisation is very different.</p>

<p>IM: So many people create nice applications, but not apps you'd want to pay for. </p>

<p>LKF: In some emerging markets, we saw mobile banking as strong.</p>

<p>Q (Andrew Scott, Rummble): You need to focus on product, not revenue.</p>

<p>Q: (Martin, Layar) How should we charge?<br><br />
IG: It feels like a killer app. I'd make a 30m drama about it to get the story out.<br><br />
LKF: Make it work on all phones.<br><br />
PP: Think about the discovery - who's going to help me find it?<br><br />
IG: Make it newsworthy. Save a life with it, get it on the news.</p>

<p>Q: I keep hearing talk about money. But I like the iPhone because people can make an app without having money, and release it to a community - for social capital. Why do we focus on financial game? Why can't we help make life better?<br><br />
A: If you're talking about a venture funded business, VCs have a different model. Bootstrap, don't talk to a VC - unless you're making something beyond amazing or your team has already done it before, your valuation will be so low... VCs are banks. The app store today is a good model for small developers, or Salesforce etc (having a mobile implementation of a pre-existing platform online).</p>
