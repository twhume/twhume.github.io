<p>So, it's been a week since I got back from <a href="http://mobile20.eu">Mobile 2.0</a> - and therefore highly remiss that I've not written about it yet.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed both the Developer Day and the main event. The former seemed to be focused around mobile web - with widgets in particular getting a lot of prominence. Whilst I'm not convinced that widgets are the future of all mobile apps, it's an area where - until recently - I've let myself lag behind a little, so I got a lot out of the sessions.  And one quote from the very beginning has stuck with me - <a href="http://www.torgo.com/blog/">Dan Appelquist</a> remarking that applications are nowadays being consumed <a href="http://www.torgo.com/blog/2009/06/apps-are-like-songs.html">more like songs than software</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/3669612628/" title="Opening Panel by twhume, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3641/3669612628_7450b90cb6_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Opening Panel" align="right" hspace="10" vpsace="5"/></a><br />
The main event was pretty decent. On both days some panel discussions had a tendency to get a bit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_many_angels_can_stand_on_the_head_of_a_pin%3F">angels-on-pinheads</a> - the one where 4 people debated publicly about who was most "open", each using a slightly different definition of the much overused word, didn't really hold my attention. But the off-track talks really shone for me - <a href="http://www.greenmonk.net/">Tom Raftery</a> <a href="http://mobile20.eu/2009/06/22/mobile-20-europe-tom-raftery-on-mobile-sustainability/">berating the industry</a> for its at best token gestures towards environmentalism, and <a href="http://we-make-money-not-art.com/">Regine Beatty</a> and <a href="http://www.sensorband.com/atau/">Atau Tanaka</a> one-upping each other with wonderful examples of <a href="http://mobile20.eu/2009/06/24/mobile-2-0-europe-atau-tanaka/">mobile</a> <a href="http://mobile20.eu/2009/06/23/mobile-2-0-europe-regine-debatty-we-make-money-not-art-com/">frivolity</a>. And outside of these, Ted Morgan of <a href="http://www.skyhookwireless.com/">Skyhook</a> talking about <a href="http://mobile20.eu/2009/06/22/mobile-20-europe-context-by-ted-morgan-skyhook-wireless/">their business</a> (200m location searches a day, vs 300m or so Google searches per day!) and Priya Prakash's talk on <a href="http://mobile20.eu/2009/06/22/mobile-20-europe-beyond-free-what-is-the-customer%E2%80%99s-perception-of-%E2%80%9Cfree%E2%80%9D-by-priya-prakash/">Beyond Free</a> (an evolution of the last few sessions I've seen her do) were particularly memorable.</p>

<p>The venues (<a href="http://www.barcelonactiva.cat/barcelonactiva/cat/">Barcelona Activa</a> and <a href="http://www.esade.edu/">ESADE</a>) were both excellent (modulo the temperature of rooms in the former, which got quite stuffy). Now I've experienced the double-whammy of rock-solid wi-fi and power at every seat, I suspect I'm going to be a little spoilt.</p>

<p>More than this though, on a personal level I got a lot out of the event. It seemed to have a perfect mix of 50% familiar faces and 50% new (and friendly) ones - I'm not a natural networker, but felt very comfortable at the event. And in particular it was great to finally meet <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Dom/">Dom</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/all#fd">Francois</a> of the W3C and <a href="http://www.thisismobility.com/blog/">Mike Rowehl</a> - all of whom I've known for a while, but only in a virtual sense. It's nice to have that corrected :)</p>

<p>I did a couple of sessions; one on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/twh/mobile-user-experience-1604300">Mobile User Experience</a> for Developer Day, which was well attended but missed the mark a little, I felt. I emphasised how we run UX alongside development at FP over and above the specifics of mobile UX, and whilst my audience seemed happy to engage on this, I think I could've either been clearer in the title for the session, or put more emphasis on tactics than on process.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/3669641408/" title="Visualising location lookups by twhume, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2448/3669641408_d05b0838e9_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Visualising location lookups" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5"/></a>The "play" panel I sat on at the very end of the event was a different matter: really good fun, and an utter privilege to talk about location-based gaming, ghost hunting, shitting and sex, generative music and digital rights issues with <a href="http://www.sensorband.com/atau/">Professor Tanaka</a>, <a href="http://www.gustavsoderstrom.com/">Gustav Soderstrom</a> of <a href="http://www.spotify.com/en/">Spotify</a>, Akhil Monappa of <a href="http://www.atlasventure.com/">Atlas Venture</a>, and <a href="http://more.rjdj.me/michael-breidenbruecker/">Michael Breidenbruecker</a> - the lovable nutter behind <a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a> and <a href="http://more.rjdj.me/">RJDJ</a> - all ably held together by <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/author/robin/">Robin Wauters of TechCrunch</a>. </p>

<p>And again, on a personal note I had a very interesting chat with Ted Morgan at the post-event dinner, learning exactly what it's like to get into work one day and find a message from Steve Jobs on your voicemail :)<br />
 <br />
Thanks to <a href="http://www.m-trends.org/">Rudy</a>, <a href="http://www.torgo.com/blog/">Dan</a>, and all the organisers and behind-the-scenes folks who made it happen. I'm already looking forward to next year, though I think I might give myself an extra day in Barcelona to help recover from <a href="http://2009.sonar.es/es/">Sonar</a>...<br />
