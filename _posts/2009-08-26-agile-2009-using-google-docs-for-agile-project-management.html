<p>A couple of chaps from <a href="http://www.bestbrains.dk/english.aspx">Best Brains</a> gave a talk on using Google Docs as a project management tool. We use Google Docs an awful lot ourselves, so there weren't many surprises here - and I'm ashamed to say my notes are pretty nonexistent, as most of the slides were video-demos or very visual in nature.</p>

<p>They had some lovely cumulative burndown charts which nicely showed the flow of work between development, testing and done - an improvement on the charts we've been using which I might steal^H^H^H^H^Hbe inspired by.</p>

<p>And they gave an interesting looking demo of how to use a Google Spreadsheet to operate a retrospective with a remote team - having individuals fill in and colour cells as a substitute for writing on post-its. As with many practices involving distributed teams, I suspect it's not as good as being in the same room... but it felt like it might have been significantly better than dropping the practice of retrospecting altogether.</p>

<p>The speakers are awarded 7 (seven) Hume Points for beginning their talk with Jazz clarinet.</p>
