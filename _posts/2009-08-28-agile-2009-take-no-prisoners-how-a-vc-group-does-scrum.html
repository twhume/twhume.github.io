<p>"<a href="http://agile2009.agilealliance.org/node/1230">Take no prisoners, how a VC group does Scrum</a>" was a chance to see <a href="http://jeffsutherland.com/">Jeff Sutherland</a> talk.<a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2009/04/shock-therapy-self-organisation-in-scrum-jeff-sutherland.html"> Last time I saw him in London</a>, he'd mentioned <a href="http://www.openviewpartners.com/">OpenView</a>, the VC Group he was involved with who were using Scrum and insisting that all their investments used it, to up performance. This was a more detailed talk from Jeff and Igor Altman (who works at OpenView) on their experiences adopting.</p>

<p>Very interesting to hear that even a Scrum team so close to the originator of the method has gone through so many familiar stages and pitfalls...</p>

<ul>
<li> Organisations get refactored, just life software does. OpenView has "refactored its Scrum implementation" 5 times so far;
<li> VC groups have highly trained, silo'd specialists;
<li> The <a href="http://jeffsutherland.com/scrum/2008/09/maxwell-curve-getting-more-production.html">Maxwell Curve</a> indicates that optimal working hours for a waterfall team are 60h/week. For a Scrum team it's 35h/week. VCs want to see their portfolio companies being optimal :)
<li> OpenView has a strategy of adding value to their investments by providing best practice, helping with execution in all areas of the business, running forums and workshops, doing on-site coaching and training. They and their portfolio companies were all full-Scrum by 2008;
<li> They do this to bring operational efficiencies to all their companies and maximise ROI. They've had 2 rounds of $100m investment, employ 22 staff and have 10 portfolio companies, including <a href="http://www.versionone.com/">VersionOne</a>;
<li> The VC ran 4-person teams on 1-week sprints, tracking in hours not story points (they couldn't get their heads around SPs); initially they adopted the trappings of Scrum but not much more;
<li> The team became self-managing, communications got better, they noticed themselves aggressively eliminating low-value work with stress reduced and impediments around clarity and communication;
<li> Quote: "If you're working long hours, you aren't doing scrum" - particularly surprising to hear that from a VC;
<li> Challenges they still had were overrunning meetings and some people uncomfortable with it all;
<li> In January 08 their planning took 1d (for a week sprint), with standups at 45m. But August planning was half a day and standups 15m;
<li> They noticed themselves oscillating between concentrating on quality and velocity; some team members were missing the big picture; and too many projects were dragging out whilst they were all being done in parallel;
<li> By November 08 they were running 2 teams of 4 staff, focusing on initiatives (epics) to give more "big picture", fewer simultaneous projects, and knowledge sharing through learning-lunch type things;
<li> They found they needed to balance direction, speed, quality and sustainability quite actively;
<li> Removing impediments without addressing the root causes usually led to those impediments returning later on - so they do RCA regularly now;
</ul>
