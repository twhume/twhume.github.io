<p>Diana Larsen and James Shore presented "<a href="http://www.agile2009.org/node/915">The Agile CTO</a>", a session for executives (oooh get me) which had the aim of bringing out and discussing a few consistent concerns that they have about their position.</p>

<ul>
<li> Their research was based on interviews with 8 CTOs from a variety of companies - sized from 8 up to thousands;
<li> Many felt the shift in priority as they moved from manager to CTO, quite keenly;
<li> Priorities changed from "how this project is going" to "how the share price is doing";
<li> They had a need to retain credibility by meeting commitments, and by not being surprised by bad news (there was a sense that it's the surprise that causes problems);
<li> They spoke of trying to create an environment where mistakes are not punished, but are accepted and analysed;
<li> Another consistent theme was time spent dealing with emotional baggage of team members;
<li> They were also a consistent love of seeing people excel, or watching their teams come up with amazing stuff that completely surprised them;
</ul>

<p>We then broke into groups to discuss other consistent themes from our experiences. Our table came out with:</p>

<ul>
<li> The need to keep abreast of industry trends and have a position on them, and how they affect our business;
<li> Balancing new product development and "lights on" maintenance activities;
<li> Representing business issues to the technology side of the business, and technology issues to the rest of the business - effectively being a conduit for information both ways;
</ul>

<p>... and some others, which I never wrote down, so they'll be lost to civilisation forever.</p>
