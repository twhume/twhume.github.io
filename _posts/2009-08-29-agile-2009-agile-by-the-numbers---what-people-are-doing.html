<p>"<a href="http://agile2009.agilealliance.org/node/263">Agile by the numbers - what people are doing</a>" was a talk by the enjoyable spikey <a href="http://www.ambysoft.com/">Scott Ambler</a>. Scott had been running some surveys to try and get to the bottom of what agile teams were actually doing - as opposed to what they claimed to be doing. Scott hypothesised that there's a bit of a macho developer culture which perhaps inhibits the ready dissemination of truth :)</p>

<p>His findings:</p>

<ul>
<li> 76% of organisations "do agile" - it's not a marginal practice any more;
<li> Within these organisations, only 44% of the teams are "doing agile" (he doesn't try and define what this actually means, this is according to the teams definition of agile);
<li> Teams of up to 10 developers tend to succeed more: agile seems to be easier with smaller teams. But that said, there are lots of people succeeding with larger teams;
<li> Most agile processes *are* empirical;
<li> 3/4 of teams using agile are doing legacy projects - i.e. it's not only used for greenfield development;
<li> Only 42% of agile teams are colocated - another 42% are driving distance or further apart;
<li> 56% of agile teams produce documentation in the form of a "vision document";
<li> The average agile project takes 3.9 weeks to warm up, before code starts being written - developers aren't typically diving into building stuff immediately;
<li> According to a fairly exhaustive DDJ survey, agile works better than other methods;
<li> 70% of projects are accurate to within 30% of their best estimate. The other 30% of projects are less accurate. But most businesses require projects to be accurate to within 9% of the original estimate;
</ul>
