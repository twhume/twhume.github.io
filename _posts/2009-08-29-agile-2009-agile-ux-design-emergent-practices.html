<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/3866421562/" title="Jeff Patton by twhume, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3451/3866421562_83c9496d4a_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Jeff Patton" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5"/></a>To my regret, I only got to see a single session from <a href="http://www.agileproductdesign.com/blog/">Jeff Patton</a> - <a href="http://agile2009.agilealliance.org/node/2911">Agile UX Design Emergent Practices</a>, a documentation of patterns he's observed multiple design teams end up using to fit into an agile environment.</p>

<p>I hope Jeff gets slides online soon - it was a fantastic presentation but I was in a post-workshop slump and my notes are less than complete or useful:</p>

<ul>
<li> UX practitioners find it hard to adapt to an agile environment. They typically go through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KÃ¼bler-Ross_model">the five stages of grief</a> as they adjust;
<li> Jeff was one of the first people he could find to go through this, "the tallest of the pygmies" as he modestly puts it - until he found <a href="http://craigvillamor.com/">Craig Villamor</a> of Salesforce;
<li> Why is it so hard? Jeff theorises it's about homonyms - words which designers and developers use, with each applying different meanings;
<li> For instance, to a developer, design is "how"; to a designer, it's "what"; for a developer an iteration is a timebox, to a designer it's a representation of the product; and so forth;
<li> Patterns have emerged! For instance...
<li> Design work getting chunked effectively: good designers working in agile teams learn to do this well;
<li> UX as part of the Product Owner or customer team;
<li> Product Owner as a team blending many skills, not an individual;
<li> Internal product releases to break up the sometimes long periods between public releases;
<li> Learning how to do "just enough" work up front, in a "sprint zero" which can take place "whilst the developers are getting CruiseControl working" - much knowing laughter from the room at that one;
<li> UX owning, or co-owning, the product backlog;
<li> Use of story maps;
<li> Owning a time machine, in order to travel forwards and backwards during the project; in each sprint evaluating work from the previous sprint, supporting the developers on the current one, and doing research for the next;
<li> Cultivating a pool of users who can be available for user testing at short notice, and using these users to do post-testing of existing software and pre-testing of prototypes;
<li> RITE testing (James Box <a href="http://www.jeckecko.net/blog/2008/08/07/silverback-rite-sitting-in-a-tree/">wrote a nice intro</a> to this a while back);
<li> Letting a prototype and conversation be the specification, instead of relying on documentation;
<li> Having "designer/developers" who get their hands dirty with code;
</ul>

<p>Jeff ended with a lovely assertion: that whilst adapting to agile was difficult, he thinks that using agile leads to better-designed products than traditional methodologies. /me claps until my hands fall off.</p>
