<p>A couple of stories have stuck in my craw recently concerning app stores:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.viewfromlondon.com/2009/09/app-store-shootout---week-1-results.html">This test</a>, distributing a free application, showed Ovi getting 10 times the downloads of the Apple App Store. Interesting-ish, though I'd to have seen a comparison figure for Android, and a similar study for a paid app. We see reasonable download figures for free Android apps...
<li> ... but paid apps seem to be a different matter - Larva labs have gamely <a href="http://larvalabs.com/blog/iphone/android-market-sales/">published their figures</a>: $62.39 per day on average;
<li> Meanwhile back at the App Store - it's iPod Touch owners who are the largest consumers of content, people spend an hour a day engaging with apps, and most discovery is happening on-device, not on PC - <a href="http://blog.creamglobal.com/right_brain_left_brain/2009/08/mobile-web-and-app-metrics.html">according to Admob metrics</a>;
</ul>
