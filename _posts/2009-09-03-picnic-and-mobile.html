<p>I'm going to miss <a href="http://www.picnicnetwork.org/">PICNIC</a> this year - if September were a stomach, it would be full of lumpy bits and some tasty stuff, unpleasantly distended, and painful to the touch. I'm particularly annoyed because this year seems to have a hefty mobile element, in particular <a href="http://www.picnicnetwork.org/page/52648/en">PICNIC Mobile Bites</a> which <a href="http://www.m-trends.org/">Rudy</a> and <a href="http://dotopen.com/blog/dotopen-partners-with-picnic-amsterdam-2009/">dotOpen</a> are organising...</p>
