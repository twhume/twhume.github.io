<p>The Mobile Web Best Practices Working Group, which I form a tiny cog of, has released a couple of Last Call documents:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ct-guidelines/">Guidelines for Web Content Transformation Proxies</a> as to whether and how they should transform web content;
<li> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mwabp/">Mobile Web Application Best Practices</a>, guidelines for how to develop and deliver web applications to mobiles;
</ul>

<p>These are both open to public review; please do send comments through to the <a href="mailto:public-bpwg-comments@w3.org">public-bpwg-comments@w3.org</a> public mailing-list</p>
