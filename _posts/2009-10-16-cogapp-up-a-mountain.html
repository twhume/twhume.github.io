<p>After <a href="http://www.roddis.org/">Tristan</a> came along to the <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2009/09/mobile-mountains-over-the-air-2009.html">Mobile Mountains Agile/UX session at OverTheAir</a>, we lent him the kit and he ran it internally at <a href="http://www.cogapp.com/">CogApp</a>, a Brighton company specialising in digital media and user experience.</p>

<p>His colleague John wrote up the experience <a href="http://blog.cogapp.com/2009/10/15/mountain-ttop/">here</a>: "<i>All the teams had to adapt their development to accommodate the new technology and whilst some (a campfire emulator was adapted to incorporate a music purchasing program by one team) were more successful than others (Journey Up took a big hit when GPS was removed from our phoneâ€™s spec), it showed how important it is to keep the wider audience in mind at all stages of development.</i>"<br />
