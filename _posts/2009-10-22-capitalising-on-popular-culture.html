<p>I did a talk at <a href="http://www.mobilewebevent.com/">Mobile Web and Applications</a> yesterday, grandiosely titled, "<em>Capitalising on Popular Culture: the Interplay between Apps and Society</em>". I was looking at places where mobile applications are just starting to go mass-market, with a view to seeing what we could learn from these early examples, and I picked out mapping (in the form of Google Maps) and personal fitness (<a href="http://nikeplusactive.nike.com/">Nike+</a> and <a href="http://www.gymfu.com/">GymFu</a>) as my reference points.</p>

<p>Many thanks to <a href="http://jofarnold.com/">Jof Arnold</a> of <a href="http://www.gymfu.com/">GymFu</a> and Craig Patton of <a href="http://www.rga.com/">R/GA</a> for their help in preparing this talk. You can find slides and notes <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/twh/capitalising-on-popular-culture">here</a>.</p>
