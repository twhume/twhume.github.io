<p>If I was going to build a dream team to run a mobile event here in the UK, it'd have to include the folks behind <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2006/04/swedish_beers.html">Swedish Beers</a>, <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2009/09/project-bluebell.html">Over the Air</a>, <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2005/11/momomo.html">Mobile Monday</a>, <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2009/06/mobile-20.html">Mobile 2.0</a> and the <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2008/11/future-of-mobile-2008.html">Future of Mobile</a> - all favourite events that I've ranted on about before now, and had the pleasure of participating in.</p>

<p>Luckily I don't have to bother building this team, because they've gone and gotten together anyway... and it looks like they're doing something a little bit different. <a href="http://www.mobileheroes.net/">Heroes of the Mobile Screen</a> is running in London this December, and they've picked four very sensible topics for it: where's the money? What does all this social and location stuff mean? What do the kids make of this? And what to customers, and particularly women, want?</p>

<p>All really great stuff, and even better for having brought together a crowd of speakers that isn't just the usual faces...<br />
