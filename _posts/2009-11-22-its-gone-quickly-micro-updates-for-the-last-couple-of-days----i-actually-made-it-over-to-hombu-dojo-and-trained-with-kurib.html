Micro-updates for the last couple of days:</p>

<ul>
<li> I actually made it over to <a href="http://www.aikikai.or.jp/eng/index.htm">Hombu dojo</a> and trained with Kuribayashi sensei. Really good fun, very friendly class (about 25% Westerners as far as I could tell), not as austere as I'd feared. Hombu mats are unusually hard and *really* slippery. I found the class very tough to follow, not speaking a word of Japanese - but everyone was very friendly and I partnered with a succession of grinning yudansha who took pity on me. Sensei came over and used me for uke at one point, commenting that was I too focused on one thing. I'll try and work that one out...
<li> Kiddyland has eaten my wallet - thanks for dumping that one on me, Julie... it's basically the worlds best toy shop, 7 floors of really cool shit. I particularly enjoyed the Star Wars and Ghibli floors on each of my visits.
<li> After moving hotel (from the Grand Prince Akasaka to the Diamond) I popped over to Ueno zoological gardens yesterday and meandered around the zoo itself. The giant panda is gone (relatively recently, judging by all the signs apologising for the lack of a giant panda) but there's a good selection of bears (polar and grizzly), a dead cute red panda (think panda/raccoon cross but twice as cute), gorillas and some fun otters. 
<li> Woke up at 3:30am this morning (again) and took advantage of the early start to head down to the fish market at Tsukiji and grab some breakfast. I missed the famous tuna auction, but had a delicious plate of fresh fishness at a little street-side cafe type thing which has set me up nicely for the day. One thing I've noticed on this trip is how much more relaxing it is to wander around an unfamiliar town with a GPS-enabled map... I've had close-to-zero worry of getting lost which makes the whole experience much smoother...
</ul>

But chuffing me currently is that I've managed to get back in contact with an old Brighton chum who I last saw on my last visit to Tokyo, 9 years ago. So hopefully beers to follow there...</p>
