<li><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5419435/a-romance-flowchart-when-is-it-inappropriate-to-use-your-iphone">When is it inappropriate to use your iPhone</a> - a romance flowchart;
<li><a href="http://gigaom.com/2009/12/06/all-hail-the-ipod-touch/">All hail the iPod touch</a>; isn't it kinda amusing that one of the most popular mobile devices is completely disconnected from any traditional mobile network? Kinda says something about the telecomms industry I think;
<li><a href="http://www.gyford.com/phil/writing/2009/12/02/design.php">Is modern web design too like print design</a>: "<i>It feels like we’ve lost the “webness” of web design over an incredibly short period</i>". Absolutely agree. We seem to have falled into a bit of a rut as far as our expectations of web design go...

<li><a href="http://simonwillison.net/2009/Nov/23/node/">Node.js</a>, an asynchronous framework for web applications. Can't decide if this is really cute (performance suggests so), or insanely evil (in that it seems to be retrofitting the WWW with select() calls)...
<li>If you're a fluent Japanese speaker, perhaps you could tell me 
<a href="http://ad.impress.co.jp/special/govuk0911/">what I'm talking about here</a>? It's one of the interviews from my week in Japan...
<li> Simple and gorgeous - <a href="http://www.richardsnotes.org/archives/2009/12/06/bill-atkinsons-photocard/">PhotoCard for the iPhone</a>, an app to send email or physical postcards.
<li> <a href="http://www.cennydd.co.uk/2009/i-blame-the-designer/">I Blame The Designer</a>: "<i>Of course clients aren’t skilled designers; that’s why they had the foresight to hire us. But you know what? They know business. They’re as passionate, committed and talented as anyone. Many of them put their livelihoods on the line to make the web happen. And let’s be blunt: they also pay our salaries.</i>". Bravo!
