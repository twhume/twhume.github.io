<p>I love this <a href="http://www.mobile-ent.biz/features/239/QA-with-HTC">interview with Jon French of HTC</a>. Not because of what he reveals about their approach to the Sense UI; not because after 10 years of Nokia and Sony Ericsson loyalty, I'm a happy HTC user myself; but because of this quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<em><strong>Plenty of previously agnostic OEMs have now launched app stores. Where’s yours?</strong><br>
We have no plans for an app store. HTC is not in that business. For us, it’s all about how you integrate the app store – whether Windows Marketplace or Android Market – into the experience of using the device.</em>
</blockquote>

<p>How refreshing; a large player in mobile with no plans to open yet another app store!</p>
