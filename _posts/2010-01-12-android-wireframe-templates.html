<p>Here's a little something for all you people making lovely apps for Android. If you use a pencil before you start to take your app to the digital realm, then we've made some <a href="http://gliderguns.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/android_wireframe_templates3.pdf" title="Android_Wireframe_Templates.pdf">templates</a> to help you design for some of the Android handsets out there.</p>

<p>There are a whole variety of devices to choose from, with different screen resolutions, and hard or virtual keyboards. We find these help give our sketches a little context when we're presenting them internally or to clients.</p>

<p>The PDF is Letter size (8.5 inches by 11 inches) and the handsets are to scale, so you can use these quite happily for paper prototyping and get a realistic sense of scale. There's a subtle 10x10 grid on the screens to help you with your pencil based needs. If you're short on Letter paper, you can get away with printing them on A4.</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions, comments or improvements, feel free to suggest them here.</p>

<p>All that's left is to snack down on cupcake, donut or eclair, or if you're feeling greedy - all three. Enjoy - and <a href="http://gliderguns.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/android_wireframe_templates3.pdf" title="Android_Wireframe_Templates.pdf">click here</a> for the templates.</p>

<p>These templates were designed and lavishly tooled by Ali Driver, Senior Designer at Future Platforms.</p>
