<p>So, the Nexus has <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-nexus-one-starts-slow-only-sold-20000-units-in-its-first-week-2010-1?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+typepad%2Falleyinsider%2Fsilicon_alley_insider+%28Silicon+Alley+Insider%29">bombed</a>, apparently - with Flurry <a href="http://blog.flurry.com/bid/29658/Flurry-Special-Report-Google-Nexus-One-Launch-Week-Sales">reporting</a> only 20,000 new Nexus owners.</p>

<p>Hold on though - this handset launched publicly just 7 days ago! Surely it's a bit apples-and-oranges to compare sales figures for the Droid, launched 2 months ago (and before Christmas), with a device which may not even have reached all the people who've purchased it yet...? Drawing any conclusions by comparing estimated sales figures at this stage seems almost negligent, journalistically...</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: I really ought to learn how to read. The comparison is more like-for-like than I made out - looking at week 1 sales. However, I still don't think it's a fair comparison. Droid was sold through traditional channels (online, physical stores, etc.), and I'm guessing that there wasn't - for many Droid owners - a 4-day lag between ordering and getting the handset.</p>
