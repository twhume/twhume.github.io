<p>Stuff that doesn't fit into any particular category but just struck me as plain interesting:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/5417474/the-united-states-of-consumerism-interactive-edition">Consumerism heat maps</a>: "<i>...notice how the seller-heavy rural areas (yellow) are offloading their juno on the coast elites (red). What was the flow of crap to your neighborhood.</i>"
<li> An article about design considerations for long-term nuclear waste storage at <a href="http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2009/11/million-years-of-isolation-interview.html">Yucca Mountain</a>;
<li> <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/11/06/hp_mems_advance/">HP plans a trillion-sensor global stethoscope</a>: "<i>It means they can detect and respond to flutters as well as shakes. That implies they can be used to better monitor the status of buildings and bridges, fault zones in the earth, mining operations and volcanoes. In fact, any application where detecting microscopically small vibration events or patterns is important.</i>"
</ul>
