<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/3866263870/" title="Round 2 prototypes by twhume, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2480/3866263870_318ebbab32_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Round 2 prototypes" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5" /></a>I've been meaning to post this for a little while; if you're heading to <a href="http://www.liftconference.com/lift10">LIFT10</a> in Geneva this May, you'll have a chance to attend the "<a href="http://agile2009.agilealliance.org/node/2562">Mobile Mountains</a>" Agile/UX workshop which <a href="http://www.eventyr.co.uk/">Joh</a> and I <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2009/07/a-dry-run-down-the-mobile-mountain.html">have</a> <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2009/08/agile-2009-many-paths-to-the-top-of-the-mobile-mountain.html">been</a> <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2009/09/mobile-mountains-over-the-air-2009.html">running</a> over the last 9 months. It's a great way to explore an iterative product development; get some practical experience of the impact of shifting constraints; and (for developers) get some insight into a simple design process.</p>

<p>I'm particularly chuffed about this because LIFT is (as I've mentioned before) one of my favourite events, and some client work <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2009/02/lift.html">prevented</a> my attending in 2009.</p>
