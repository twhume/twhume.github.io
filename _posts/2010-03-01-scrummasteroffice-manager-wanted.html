<p>We're recruiting, for a dual ScrumMaster/Office Manager role: someone to focus full-time on identifying and fixing issues, and on improving the efficiency of everyone here at FP.</p>

<p>The right person for the job will be smart, unintimidated by technology, calm under fire, and interested in learning. They might have experience in Scrum, but that's not essential as long as they have a clear enthusiasm and willingness to learn; we'll provide a lot of support during the early stages (we have certified staff in-house and have been running Scrum ourselves for more than 2 years), and training too.</p>
