<p>So, Apple vs Google in the courts, with HTC as the first manufacturer to be Made An Example Of. I think The Register <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/03/03/apple_htc_google">has it spot on here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<i>"The case will take years to resolve, but that's no bad thing for Apple: manufacturers are going to be hesitant to create Android handsets when an Apple victory could put them out of business, a long drawn-out case could threaten the future of Android just as much as an Apple victory."</i>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn't a money-making gesture, it's hitting Google precisely where it hurts most: by discouraging other handset vendors to adopt Android at all.</p>
