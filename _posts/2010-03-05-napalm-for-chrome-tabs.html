<li> Fantastic voiceover work on <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/Technology_Topics/Design_and_User_Experience/Conceptual_Design.xhtml">this Nokia article</a> covering conceptual design. Feels like watching a 70s childrens TV programme :)
<li> Werner Vogels of Amazon on <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/11/working_backwards.html">working backwards</a>: "<i>Once we have gone through the process of creating the press release, faq, mockups, and user manuals, it is amazing how much clearer it is what you are planning to build</i>"
