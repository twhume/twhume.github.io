<ul>
<li> Entertaining presentation on <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/01/iphoning-his-way-to-retirement.html">tactics to get into the App Store</a>;
<li> The Register on <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/03/20/windows_phone_7_design/">Windows Phone 7 design</a>: "<i>If you don't have as much detail in the transition as you do in the state, you're going to get it wrong, Buxton said at Mix09.</i>";
<li> <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0003cy&topic_id=1">Tufte waded in on W7 too</a>, and quite sharply: "<i>The WP7S screens look as if they were designed for a PP slide presentation or for a video demo ... and not for an handheld interface</i>"
<li> Fisherprice <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/03/18/fisher-price-iphone-apps/">launch iPhone Apps</a>, no surprise given how the very young seem to take to touch UI... I hope we get to show off what we've been doing in this area one day.
<li> Interesting piece on <a href="http://geoffnorthcott.com/blog/2010/02/brand-iphone-apps-benchmarks-for-success/">how to think of success benchmarks for app launches</a>;
<li> I'm a sucker for tech folklore and I'm old enough to remember Windows 2.0, so I loved this piece on <a href="http://technologizer.com/2010/03/08/the-secret-origin-of-windows/">the secret origin of Windows</a>, the tale of how this beast actually got launched...
<li> Someone's leaked the <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/03/iphone-developer-program-license-agreement-all">iPhone developer agreement</a>. Good.
<li> Apple have a new stance on off-the-shelf apps and launchers: <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/07/apple-cookie-cutter-apps/">they've got to do more than that</a>. I'm simultaneously pleased to see the bar raised, and a bit worried that this class of app might be unavailable, when on other app stores they're pretty popular (<a href="http://forum.getjar.com/developer/news/GetJar/Press_Releases/GetJars_new_ADP_service_drives_over_8_million_downloads_for_Facebook">8 million downloads of Facebook on GetJar, for instance</a>);
<li> Lovely presentation on <a href="http://fury.com/2010/02/jesse-shells-mindblowing-talk-on-the-future-of-games-dice-2010/">game design, game-like mechanics, and convergence</a>. Well worth 20 minutes.
</ul>

<p>Consider Spring now cleaned. I'm off for a week of R&R, hiding out in a cottage in Devon with a pile of books and a copy of Eclipse. <a href="http://pleaserobme.com/">PleaseRobMe</a> users please note I'm leaving Rosehill guarded by a brace of slack-bowelled lions and in the broadsword-wielding hands of <a href="http://twitter.com/joh">@joh</a>.</p>
