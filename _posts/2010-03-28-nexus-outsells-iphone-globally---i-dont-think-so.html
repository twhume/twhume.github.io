<p>Hmm, so the <a href="http://www.mobilemarketingwatch.com/google-nexus-one-outsells-iphone-globally-in-february-5871/">Nexus outsold the iPhone globally in February</a>? This tweaked my scepticism gland, painfully. Especially as the articles is itself a quote from a <a href="http://www.3g.co.uk/PR/March2010/Google-Nexus-One-Outsells-iPhone-3G.html">fairly shallow piece elsewhere</a>, which itself is a quote from <a href="http://www.rcs.com/web_2005/">one distributor</a> of devices.</p>

<p>So this looks to me like one online trader of mobile devices noting a difference in iPhone and Nexus sales (fair enough, I'd imagine most iPhones are sold by Apple or operators)... being quoted by another site - and in the process their "16% more Nexuses sold in February" being misquoted as "Nexus Outsells iPhone Globally".</p>

<p>I'm fundamentally a fan of the Nexus (and I use one as my primary phone myself), but I've yet to meet someone who's actually paid for one. I love what Google are doing to seed them amongst developers, but it'd be really nice to see some Real People using one.<br />
