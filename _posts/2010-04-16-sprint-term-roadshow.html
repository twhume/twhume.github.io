<p>I've been meaning to blog these... over the next couple of months I'll be out and about, speaking at a few events:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.telco2.net/event/europe2010/index.php">Telco 2.0</a> on the 28/29 April, where I'll be presenting a comparison of what it's like to launch products on various platforms and through operator portals and app stores;
<li> The mighty <a href="http://liftconference.com/lift10">LIFT2010</a> on 5-7 May, where I'm running our <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2009/08/agile-2009-many-paths-to-the-top-of-the-mobile-mountain.html">Mobile Mountains</a> workshop as part of the open programme - the sign up is <a href="http://liftconference.com/lift10/workshops/many-paths-top-mobile-mountain">here</a> if you're interested in attending;
<li> <a href="http://www.eduserv.org.uk/events/esym10">Eduserv Symposium</a> on 13th May, where I'll be giving a general introduction to developing for mobile: what's different about the mobile value chain vs fixed-internet, approaches to design and development, and a few trends we've seen here;
<li> At <a href="http://www.camerjam.com/events/m-publishing/">M-Publishing</a> in June, I shall be flying the flag for free content in a debate with Stephen Pinches of the Financial Times;
</ul>

<p>All that, and I'll be out and about at these fine events too:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://uxcamplondon.org/">UXCampLondon</a> tomorrow, where I think I'll try to paper over a lack of preparedness by running a discussion session;
<li> <a href="http://www.amiando.com/gknr2010.html">Geek'n'Rolla</a> this coming Tuesday, a startup-focused event <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2009/04/geeknrolla-riba.html">which was excellent last year</a>;
<li> <a href="http://www.wiredsussex.com/events/1004/brightonfestivalregister.asp">Brighton Festival Hack Day</a>, which looks low-key, but the sentiment is a good one. Would love to see Brighton Council do a similar event...
<li> A little further out but worth marking in the diary: <a href="http://mobile20.eu/">Mobile 2.0 Europe</a> on June 16-17, which was absolutely top last year and dovetails all-too-conveniently with <a href="http://2010.sonar.es">Sonar</a>...
</ul>
