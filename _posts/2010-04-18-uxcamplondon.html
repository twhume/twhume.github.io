Held at the extravagantly spacious offices of <a href="http://www.lbi.co.uk/">LBi</a> on Brick Lane, with security provided by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/4527968054/">elite attack badgers</a>, attendance was down a little from last years event: ash stopped play for a few people.</p>

<p>I'd completely failed to write a presentation in time, so instead ran a little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbowl_(conversation)">fishbowl</a>-style discussion on something that's been gently nagging at me for a few months: what the intimacy of mobile as a medium might mean for the products and services we build on it. These physically close and available devices are simultaneously private (storing in-depth personal information) and public (as status symbols and loudspeakers); and as touch interfaces become more commonplace, the basic mechanisms for interacting with them become less intellectual and more instinctual: witness the speed with which any 4-year old gets to grip with an iPhone.</p>

<p>As a format, Fishbowl worked quite nicely: we heard opinion from across the 10 or so attendees without anyone jockeying to speak or being talked over. I found simultaneously facilitating and trying to contribute a bit icky (as usual). I've stuck my notes from the session <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/4528024824/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/4527404011/">here</a>, but to put a bit more meat on their bones:</p>

<ul>
<li> Despite being intimate, mobile is often a proxy for intimacy - a means of avoiding or substituting for it.
<li> Sharing a mobile in the UK is something we're fairly uncomfortable with; in other cultures it's quite natural.
<li> As use of sensors for data capture increases and we start to gather, say, in-depth health information what happens to all this data? Who secures it, retains it, and how?
<li> We ended up splitting device ownership from account ownership. Wouldn't it be good to be able to half-lock a device so when handing it to a friend, they can use it in a restricted fashion? The analogy of private browser in modern web browsers was used.
<li> Teenage shared use of mobiles, and group conversations around a single device as speakerphone, was brought out.
<li> <a href="http://quietstars.com/">AdrianH</a> told a tale of owning iQuarium, and being forced to kill his pet fish when upgrading from the lite to full version.
<li> Where *is* data anyway? Is the idea of data having any sort of geographical location a bit pass&eacute;?
<li> We build relationships with software over time, as we do with people.
</ul>

<p>I attended a few other sessions, all of them enjoyable, and walked away (after a post-event beer on Brick Lane) with a few tasty things to think about... Many thanks to all the organisers, attendees, and LBi for making it the day it was!</p>
