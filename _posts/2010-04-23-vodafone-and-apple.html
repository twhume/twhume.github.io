<p>Interesting, this one: Vodafone are <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/04/23/vodafone_recording/">launching a snooping service</a> which lets businesses record calls their employees are making. They're putting this onto every phone, except the iPhone:</p>

<blockquote>"<i>Vodafone tells us it's working on an iPhone version, but Apple doesn't allow interception of outgoing calls so we can't help thinking it's going to take them a while. The iPhone might not be the bankers' choice, but there are more than a few knocking around the City.</i>"</blockquote>

<p>I guess "Apple exerts control over its platform" isn't much of a story any more, but I was quite surprised to read this. Voda didn't get the iPhone with any exclusivity, so on what basis did Apple get them to sign up to this - are Apple having any operator which sells the device limit what they do with it? I'd love to know more about what other restrictions there might be....</p>
