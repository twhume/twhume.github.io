<p>Part 1: pitching. Part 2: negotiation</p>

<p>Fred is a VC focused on early-stage funding for consumer-facing innovation: e-commerce, digital media. Moving back to the US, he's the only guy left in Europe. </p>

<p>We split into groups of 4 and work out how to pitch a fake company; a few groups pitch; we get harsh feedback.</p>

<p>Our group got up and pitched a fake version of Seedcamp winner ERPLY. Feedback on our pitch:</p>

<ul>
<li> Introduction was boring; everyone knows the small business market is huge. Liven it up with a personal anecdote, perhaps. I did this bit, and completely failed to use a great line one of the guys in our group came up with: "We're SAP for small businesses";
<li> We pitched our use of Amazon as a competitive advantage; this didn't add anything and wasted time;
<li> We didn't have a clear conclusion;
<li> Asking for investment in exchange for a stated 30% investment was poor practice;
</ul>

<p>A pitch is all about honing the story. To get good terms, you need multiple offers; to get multiple offers you need to tell a good story to several investors at the same time. Investors buy stories not businesses: they fall in love, then post-rationalise. You should be able to summarise your company on the back of a business card.</p>

<p>A decent elevator pitch is also a good tool for sharing a vision internally: it's a recruitment tool.</p>

<p>You don't need a business plan, executive summary or NDA. I've never heard of an NDA being enforced.</p>

<p>You need introductions (through an investor/entrepreneur); a high-concept pitch (3 words: "flickr of video"); a bottom-up, assumptions-driven model with any real numbers you can get in there. A model that an investor can play with and stress-test. An operating plan for next 12 months. Very clear milestones and deliverables. An explicit technical roadmap (not engineering documents, an outline). 10, 15, 5 KPIs by which success is measured (read Dave McClure, etc.). A <a href="http://venturehacks.com/articles/cap-table">cap table</a>. Possibly credible market sizing.</p>

<p>Presentation doesn't matter; real-world traction is the most important thing. You're selling yourself: use social proof, if you don't have money you can find it in the ecosystem.</p>

<p>Elegance of product is important.</p>

<p>Tell a story; release your inner actor; smile; be true to yourself; raise pulse levels. Practice, practice, practice. </p>

<p>Let the audience have "aha" moments, so they feel they're smart and discovering things about your business. You're not allowed to have doubts about the team though.</p>

<p>In Europe, we have a tendency to be so fucking humble... err on the side of being salesy.</p>

<p>Embrace "pitch decay" - initial excitement decays over time. This is why you need to leave people with key takeaways. The VC you persuade will be your champion, and is now your sponsor - help him, make his life easy.</p>

<p>Be Israeli: doors close, come in through the window. 3-5 days after a meeting, follow up. No answer? Wait 2 days, follow up. VCs are busy and forget things, don't take it personally. Be pleasant enough that a VC could happily spent 8 hours stuck with you at an airport.</p>

<p><strong>Part 2: negotiation</strong></p>

<p>We split into teams of two: one team is investors, another entrepreneurs. They get different information on the company and their needs and negotiate. This was fun :)</p>

<p>Real-world valuations: they want to own 20-25% of any investment. So what's a reasonable price?</p>

<p>The only thing that really matters is price per share: bring it back to this every time. Option pools are important to build strong teams and legitimate but affect this. </p>

<p>Don't let investors tell you the size of the option pool (though they can provide useful input). Use a hiring plan to justify a small option pool, increase your share price and increase your effective valuation. Underestimating the size of the option pool is a classic mistake.</p>

<p>Liquidation preferences are designed to push the valuation hurdle out and ensure investors get their money back.</p>

<p>Boards are important. Companies are benevolent dictatorships; the board exists to ensure he's optimally benevolent. The CEO works for the board. Bad dictators get beheaded...</p>

<p>Legals are designed to cover a downside - you get run over by a bus and investors end up dealing with your heir. Don't take them personally. Secure the social contract: companies always go wrong at some point, and big companies have big problems. Documents don't help here, but a social contract will.</p>
