<li> Romain Guy and Chet Haase do a <a href="http://graphics-geek.blogspot.com/2010/04/video-animation-rules-on-parleyscom.html">lovely presentation on animation techniques</a>;
<li> <a href="http://www.mogotix.com/">Mogotix</a>: "<i>The easy way to create and manage any event with mobile tickets</i>";
<li> <a href="http://www.fancyhands.com/">Fancy Hands</a>: "<i>a team of a assistants ready to work for you right now. You should focus on what's important, let us focus on the rest</i>";
<li> <a href="http://kgutteridge.co.uk/blog/2010/04/11/rather-than-banning-tools-ideas-from-palm-to-raise-the-standard-of-iphone-apps/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+kgutteridge+(kgutteridge)&utm_content=Google+Reader">Cute idea for raising app quality in stores</a>: charge $50 to submit an app, so "<i>if the developer doesn’t believe their application is going to return at least $50 they will be unlikely to submit it or burn through cash and be stopped that way.</i>"
<li> <a href="http://www.crackunit.com/2010/01/01/best-lecture-ever/">Excellent lecture on problem-solving</a> from Barry Nalebuf. I will never eat a banana the same way again.
<li> <a href="http://moconews.net/article/419-smule-awards-5000-to-winner-of-i-am-t-pain-video-contest/">Smule announce the winner</a> of their "I am T-Pain" competition. "<i>you can call me Steve﻿ Jobbs cuz i got soo many app</i>" I *heart* Smule, so I was chuffed to hear they <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-app-store-developer-smule-raises-8-million-2009-12?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+typepad%2Falleyinsider%2Fsilicon_alley_insider+%28Silicon+Alley+Insider%29">raised more funding at the end of last year</a>
<li> <a href="http://comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2009/12/Android_Crashing_the_Smartphone_Party">Android and iPhone users are very similar</a>: US-only but still interesting (and other smartphone owners aren't that different either). I also note that Android seems to be recognised more by consumers in this survey than I'd expect...
<li> Completely non-technical, but I was intrigued to see the old Head of Theology from my boarding school, Father Hunwicke, is now <a href="http://liturgicalnotes.blogspot.com/2009/12/epicurus-has-tea-with-girls.html">blogging</a>. Much of the church-politics side of things goes over my head, but his online writing retains the distinctive style I remember from his teaching and is well worth a read: "<i>I doubt if our culture of instant polybonk delivers a quarter of the pleasure of wondering whether she really meant to brush your hand with hers as she offered you another sandwich.</i>"
