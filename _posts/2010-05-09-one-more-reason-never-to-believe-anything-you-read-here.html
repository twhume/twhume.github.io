<p>Hah. Just found <a href="http://mobhappy.com/blog1/2007/01/10/more-views-on-the-iphone/">this</a> whilst searching around for something I said years back:</p>

<blockquote>"<i>I donâ€™t see this as meaningfully impacting on the mass market (other than giving a slight kicking to other handset vendors)</i>"</blockquote>

<p>That'll be the iPhone, then. Oh, I could argue that a few percentage of market share isn't an impact on the mass-market... but impact ain't just how many of them you ship, it's how much they affect everyone else in the ecosystem, and iPhone - like many Apple products - has had impact disproportionate to its market-share.</p>
