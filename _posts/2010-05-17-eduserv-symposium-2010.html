<p>I attended and presented at <a href="http://eduserv.org.uk/events/esym10">the Eduserv Symposium</a> last week, an annual event for technologists in education. Notes are a bit lacking, I'm afraid, but an excellent venue (the Royal College of Phyicians, where I think WAP Wednesdays of yore were held), solid wi-fi and a strong lineup of speakers made for a good day. I was pleasantly surprised by the interest and engagement of the audience, too - education not being a sector that I'd immediately associate with enthusiasm for the new.</p>

<p>I presented some real-world experiences launching mobile apps, drawing on our work for Puzzler and a piece of concept work we did for Channel 4 Education a couple of years ago. You can find the slides online <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/twh/eduserv-2010">here</a>.</p>
