So, starting with the oldest first... Secret Lewis, which launched in March.</p>

<p>Last year we were approached by <a href="http://www.ndreams.co.uk/">nDreams</a>, a developer and publisher of games, to help them with the mobile element of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game">ARG</a> they were putting together for Reebok. It turns out that Lewis Hamilton is not only a Formula 1 racing driver - he also moonlights rescuing works of art that have been stolen... and he needs help. The ARG runs from March until October this year, and is split into five episodes, with a mobile game for each.  You can pick up the first episode ("Shanghai Mansion") <a href="http://www.getjar.com/mobile/36229/lewis-hamilton:-shanghai-mansion/">here</a> on Getjar. The games themselves are built for a wide range of feature-phone handsets, and we've produced 8 language versions. This is an international game built for an international audience that's wider than just iPhone and Android owners; much as we love the power and flexibility of modern mobiles, we love reaching the other 97% of the world too.</p>

<p>A nice little behind-the-scenes detail of Secret Lewis is the workflow between us and nDreams. There's a web-based Unity version of each episode, and we take a data file exported from this, run it through a rather nifty parser, and use this to generate new game files which the MIDlet consumes: so the mobile and web games are naturally kept in sync.</p>

<p>We'll be launching more episodes of Secret Lewis in the coming months...</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: how remiss of me, I've realised that I failed to give a shout to the team at FP who put Secret Lewis together - mea culpa. That'll be The Fighting Mongooses, AKA Thom Hopper, Adrian Bigland, Chris Glaister, Tariq Tamuji, and Ali Driver...</p>
