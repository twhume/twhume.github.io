<p>To say that things have been busy is an understatement. I'm also out and about a lot at the moment - I had the pleasure of attending the excellent <a href="http://www.camerjam.com/events/m-publishing/">m-publishing</a> event last week run by <a href="http://www.camerjam.com">Camerjam</a>, and am about to hop off for a couple of European events. In the next month or so I'll be:</p>

<ul>
<li> Talking about approaches to J2ME development at the <a href="http://o2litmusoracle.eventbrite.com/">O2 Litmus event</a> sponsored by Sun^H^H^HOracle tomorrow evening, at Ping Pong in Liverpool Street;
<li> On-stage at <a href="http://momolo.org/event.jsp?eventid=100">Mobile Monday on 14th June</a> to discuss my favourite subject in the world ever, fragmentation;
<li> Hopping over to Barcelona for <a href="http://mobile20.eu/">Mobile 2.0 Europe</a> on 17th, where I'm running our Mobile Mountains workshop and getting a few teams of interested folk designing and testing a product in 90 minutes. I'll also be on the jury for the <a href="http://appcirc.us/">AppCircus</a> side of this event.
<li> Dragging my big bag o' wooden phones from there to <a href="http://mobilemonday.si/">Mobile Monday Slovenia</a> on 21st June, where I'm running the same workshop format again;
</ul>

<p>Pop me an mail if you fancy catching up at any of those...</p>
