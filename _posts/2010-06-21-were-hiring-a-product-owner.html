<p>Does your heart skip a beat when you launch? Are you passionate about user experience? Do you play hopscotch between the worlds of business and technology? If so, rejoice! We're looking for a new Product Owner to join <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">our team</a> in sunny Brighton.</p>

<p>If you don't know us, we're a 10-year old software business, and we take products for mobile phones from the drawing board to launch, and beyond. If we have a house style, it's making something really special using playfulness and principles of participation. We've worked for some of the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/">biggest</a> <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">names</a> in <a href="http://www.orange.co.uk/">telecoms</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">media</a>, launched some <a href="http://www.flirtomatic.com/">successful</a> <a href="http://www.zyb.com/">startups</a>, and won a <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2008/04/octobastard.html">few</a> <a href="http://overtheair.org/blog/competition/">prizes</a> along the way. We're unusually collaborative and cross-disciplinary, and tend to work quite closely with our customers.</p>

<p>The role involves working closely with our clients to understand their needs, their business and their customers; discussing these with our designers, developers and testers, and championing the resulting products internally. We don't expect you to be a mobile guru, but you will need experience in digital projects: a history in account management, as a digital producer or a product manager might prove helpful, though we'll certainly consider smart, mature applicants with other backgrounds.</p>

<p>Reporting to our lovely <a href="http://sergiofalletti.typepad.com/">Client Services Director</a>, you'll manage relationships with customers, understanding their priorities and acting as a customer proxy for our production teams. In practice this means that you'll need to:</p>

<ul>
<li> Identify, understand, prioritise and document product requirements for customers;
<li> Own customer relationships and take responsibility for driving revenues;
<li> Act as the main point of contact for clients during development, reporting progress and managing change;
<li> Work with our Client Services Director to create long-term release plans for clients;
</ul>

<p>It's a challenging role and you'll sit right at the centre of our business. You'll need to be authentic and trustworthy, with good negotiation skills. Attention to detail is crucial, project management and system modelling skills will come in very handy. We'll want to to continually develop domain knowledge for our clients, and to be able to understand their language, business and objectives.</p>
