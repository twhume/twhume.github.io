<p>I'm on holiday this week, having a fight with my attic. But before it's too late, here's a few places I'll be showing my face over the coming months:</p>

<ul>
<li> I'm speaking at <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.nl/events/17/momoams-17/#respond">Mobile Monday Amsterdam on 6th September</a>, sandwiched between Rick le Roy and Matt Webb. We're talking about design and mobile. I'll likely go straight to nuts and bolts and talk about a few things we've launched recently, how we've approached them, and where we messed up.
<li> Then it's to <a href="http://overtheair.org">Over The Air</a>, which returns to Imperial College on 10th and 11th September. I'm sitting on a panel Bryan Rieger is running, tentatively titled "What Would Picasso Do?". We're going to be talking about art and mobile, then it's heads down for the overnight hacking.
<li> On 14th December I'll be taking part in a panel session at <a href="http://events.nokia.com/developersummit2010/home.htm">Nokia Developer Summit</a>, titled "<i>Simply clever â€“ what Designs and Experiences make the user click?</i>";
<li> Come October, I'm going to form part of the business track of <a href="http://www.droidcon.co.uk/">DroidCon</a>, the UKs first Android-focused conference running in London on 28-29th. I'll likely be presenting a warts-and-all case study of Future Platforms: our experiences building and operating a business in mobile over the last 10 years. As part of this I'll be talking about some of the problems we've faced: what should you do when Noel Edmonds kidnaps your project manager in launch week? How can you best handle the pervert in the flats opposite who keeps exposing himself to your staff? And other vital issues facing digital agencies in the 21st century.
<li> Finally, I'm going to be saying something, about something, at <a href="http://open-mic.org.uk/index.php/events/openmic-8">openMIC #8</a>, which is coming to Brighton on 4th November. I've shamefully failed to make it along to any of the other openMIC events in Bristol or elsewhere, so really looking forward to making amends at this one.
</ul>

<p>A little birdie suggests that I may also be in Dublin in November to run a heavily customised version of the Mobile Mountains workshop (which I only recently swore I'd never run again). If so, we'll be digging up the corpse and reanimating it, Robocop-style. It will be better. Faster. Stronger. And fight crime. I'll post here if that's going to happen.</p>

<p>Oh, and I'm really looking forward to <a href="http://2010.uxbrighton.org.uk/">UX Brighton 2010</a>: Rory Sutherland would have been enough to drag me along, and I've never seen Eric Reiss talk, but there's a great cast of other speakers there, most of whom I've never seen on stage. </p>

<p>Last but not least, I'm also helping judge the <a href="http://bimaawards.com/">BIMAs</a> this year. I did this way back in 2002 and it was a lot of fun, I'm really looking forward to it again.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: added in the Nokia Developer Summit panel.</p>
