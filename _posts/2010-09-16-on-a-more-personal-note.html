<p>On a personal note, three things I've started doing recently:</p>

<ul>
<li> Inspired by <a href="http://www.ellendevries.org/">Not For The Faint Hearted</a> (n&eacute;e <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2009/11/write-club-1.html">Write Club</a>), every day I visit Flickr, find the top left photo on the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days/">7 Days Most Interesting</a> page, and spend 5 minutes writing a story inspired by it. I'm interested in constraints at the moment (<a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2009/08/agile-2009-many-paths-to-the-top-of-the-mobile-mountain.html">Mobile Mountains</a> was exploration of them in a worky context), and rediscovering a love of language which I shelved some time in my teenage years.
<li> I'm using <a href="http://www.mappiness.org.uk/">Mappiness</a>. Got an iPhone? Go grab it - it's a research project for the London School of Economics, looking at how people's happiness is affected by their environment. As a side-effect, you get to see charts of your own behaviour, and get a peek at the data their gathering (like the <a href="http://www.mappiness.org.uk/meters/">meters</a>). I did a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/twh/capitalising-on-popular-culture">little talk</a> covering these kinds of services at Mobile Web Summit last June: there's something really interesting about our growing desire and willingness to track our own behaviour, whether it's with Mappiness, <a href="http://www.curetogether.com/">CureTogether</a>, <a href="http://nikerunning.nike.com/">Nike+</a>, <a href="http://www.fiat.co.uk/ecodrive/">EcoDrive</a>, or <a href="http://www.withings.com/">Wi-fi bathroom scales</a>. And in the light of some of my recent antipathy towards advertising: I think that providing branded services which help us understand ourselves better is one of the few places where the ad industry can do genuine good.
<li> More of a stopping than a starting: after reading <a href="http://www.drbramwell.com/books/samples/">No News Is Good News by Dr Bramwell</a>, I've given up daily news. I don't find this too difficult - I haven't had a live TV feed into my home in a few years now, and don't listen to much radio. Mainly this involves avoiding newspapers and online news sites. I cheat slightly by using <a href="http://www.flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a> to read up on stories which my friends are discussing or find interesting. Correlation isn't causation, but I've been in a rather good mood recently. I'm going to carry on with the experiment.
</ul>
