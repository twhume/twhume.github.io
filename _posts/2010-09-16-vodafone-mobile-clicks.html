<p>A week or two back we learned that of the 50 UK entries to the <a href="http://www.vodafonemobileclicks.com/">Vodafone Mobile Clicks</a> competition, two of the 5 country finalists selected from the UK were our customers: <a href="http://www.touchnote.com/">Touchnote</a> and <a href="http://www.roulettecricket.com/">Roulette Cricket</a>. I've not written about our work for Touchnote here because it's all a little hush-hush, but you'll find out more soon, I promise. Roulette Cricket is a 2nd-screen gaming app which lets you bet on cricket games as they happen, from your iPhone. You can read more about it <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2010/04/roulette-cricket.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2010/06/slowly-slowly.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Getting to the UK finals was cause for celebration in the office, but we found out this morning that of these 5 finalists, it's Roulette Cricket who have been chosen to represent the UK in the finals of the competition. So congratulations to Dave, Simon and Stuart at RC for getting this far, and to the team here who've worked so hard on the app this year. The winner is chosen by a combination of a <a href="http://www.vodafonemobileclicks.com/vote">public vote</a>, which I'd urge you to get involved with, and a jury round at <a href="http://www.picnicnetwork.org/">PICNIC</a> in Amsterdam. Fingers crossed :)</p>
