<p>There was whooping. A man hollered. The air may or may not have been punched. An appalling cricket-related pun may have been deleted from the draft of this post.</p>

<p>Yes, last Friday we were passed news that Roulette Cricket, a product we launched earlier this year for the eponymous startup, won second place (and a not-to-be-sniffed-at 50,000 euros) in <a href="http://www.vodafonemobileclicks.com/">Vodafone Mobile Clicks</a>, a high profile competition to find the best mobile Internet startup in Europe. Having put a great deal of thought and sweat into the app over the last 9 months, we're absolutely chuffed; and we think that some of the principles underlying the app (its use of live data and unashamedly humble attitude towards being used as a "second screen") are interesting ones that you'll see a lot more of in coming years.</p>

<p>There's a video which communicates some of the tension behind the final presentations and judging at PICNIC in Amsterdam <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFm60dV8T7Q">here</a>, and you can learn more about Roulette Cricket on their web site <a href="http://www.roulettecricket.com/">here</a>, or in my blatherings <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2010/04/roulette-cricket.html">here</a>, or <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2010/06/slowly-slowly.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>And of course, congratulations to the RC team - who've propelled this product from paper plates at Lord's into the Apple App Store. If you had the patience to watch the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSpiy8dTbXo&p=559C6B8A92D859BC&playnext=1&index=3">talk I gave at MoMo Amsterdam a few weeks ago</a>, you'll have seen me sing the praises of some clients who've been a wonderful mix of engaged and trusting this year. They're one of them, I'll be writing about one of the others soon :)<br />
