<p>(One in a line of blog posts that's sat in my TODO list for months)</p>

<p>I've written about <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2009/05/gold-cards.html">gold cards</a> before; they're <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">our</a> slightly less confident version of the fabled Google "20% time", and an opportunity for FPers to play, collaborate, learn, or scratch an itch. We try to push these days towards producing demonstrable (even if half-finished) products. At a bare minimum a gold card results in a short talk to the rest of the company on our planning days; most of them include demos.</p>

<p>This left us with a little pile of interesting bits and bobs: products in an indeterminate state, somewhere between "<em>oooh it works</em>" and "<em>wow that's useful</em>". Whilst we launched <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2009/09/guardian-anywhere.html">The Guardian Anywhere</a> under the Future Platforms name, quite a few of these experiments are a little rougher... so we wanted to find a place where they could be released on an unsuspecting public without necessarily having the polish that we would prefer to be associated with our work.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/3426394014/" title="Fat Parrot? by twhume, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3576/3426394014_730fea105a_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="Fat Parrot?" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5"/></a>Enter Fat Parrot, stage left. So avant garde that it doesn't even have a web site, it's a brand where we can stick stuff. Things you wouldn't normally put online; things you couldn't normally put online; things you shouldn't normally put online. Right now that's:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.androlib.com/android.application.mobi-fatparrot-game-brainsplatter-Ejqp.aspx">Brain splatter</a>, a shoot-yourself-in-the-head simulator;
<li> <a href="http://www.androlib.com/android.application.mobi-fatparrot-game-f1sh-Ejqi.aspx">F1sh</a>, a simple tile-matching game;
<li> <a href="http://www.androlib.com/android.application.com-futureplatforms-wallpaper-aliens-Ejzw.aspx">Motion sensor</a>, an Aliens-style, erm, motion sensor live wallpaper;
<li> <a href="http://www.androlib.com/android.application.mobi-fatparrot-game-croc-Ejqt.aspx">Snappy Easter</a>, a pleasantly blasphemous arcade game;
<li> <a href="http://www.androlib.com/android.application.mobi-fatparrot-game-generic-Ejqn.aspx">Zombie vs Monkie</a>, a dirt simple touch game;
<li> <a href="http://www.androlib.com/android.application.com-poggle-jAjij.aspx">Poggle</a>, an accelerometer-based puzzle game;
</ul>

<p>At the back of my mind when doing some of this stuff was the idea of topical games: that you might hear a news story in the morning, release a reskinned version of a game based on it within an hour or so, and have it available for a day or so. Deliberately disposable applications, designed to be "<em>consumed like songs</em>" as <a href="http://www.torgo.com/blog/">Mr Applesquid</a> would put it. I think there's an interesting business to be done here, but unfortunately not in app stores that have week-long lead times for a launch...</p>

<p>Poggle had a fair bit more time put into it than the others - <a href="http://tariqtamuji.blogspot.com/">Tariq Tamuji</a>, long time FP Guardian Of Quality, put it together and polished it over a period of a couple of months. We originally released it as a paid app (at a &pound;0.99) price point, thinking that it might be an interesting commercial experiment; and I'm very glad we did this.</p>

<p>In the course of about a month, Poggle sold 5 copies, 3 of those were from us. This was absolutely shocking; I'd have expected it to have racked up a small percentage (maybe 1-5%) of the equivalent downloads we have from free products - so maybe a few tens, a hundred or so - and this was way worse than that... and means that we'll be very careful about recommending Android app sales as a route to revenue for our customers. I'm not claiming it's impossible to make money selling Android apps, or that no-one is doing it... just that it's tough. I'm glad we've learned this on our own time, and that the lesson wasn't one that a customer ended up paying for.</p>

<p>As an aside... I think it should be straightforward to model the size of the Android paid download opportunity by presuming that downloads follow a quite standard power law distribution and plotting individual apps along such a curve, to extrapolate figures. We know how many apps sell more than 250,000 units, how many sell 5-10,000 units, and so forth...<br />
