<p>Small pieces, loosely launched:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://labs.lastminute.com/blog/lastminute-com-hotels-app-live-in-nokia-ovi-store/">LastMinute asked us to get them onto the Nokia N8</a>, so we build a little widget to wrap their existing mobile site in UI goodness - and also bring in some of content from hotel blogs they manage.
<li> The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ct-guidelines/">Guidelines for Web Content Transformation Proxies</a> (which the now-defunct Mobile Web Best Practices Group I've been sitting in worked on for the last couple of years) have been published by the W3C as a Working Group Note.
<li> We designed and built <a href="">the Touchnote app for Windows Phone 7</a>, recently featured on the Windows Phone 7 marketplace. I'm going to write a lot more about this soon... There's a review <a href="http://frackulous.com/075-touchnote-on-window-phone-7-out-of-office/">here</a> though: "<em>pretty damn good</em>"
<li> Oh, and <a href="http://www.roulettecricket.com/">Roulette Cricket</a> won another award: "Most Innovative New App" at <a href="http://www.mobileappsworld.net/awards/">Mobile App World</a>;
</ul>
