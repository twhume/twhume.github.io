<a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/12/simplest-phones-open-to-%E2%80%9Csms-of-death%E2%80%9D/">The simplest phones are open to "SMS of Death"</a>?<br /> <br /> I seem to recall (though can't find a reference, and Google is very mute on the topic) a talk at WAP Wednesday in 1999 on this exact topic, from some folks who went into a lot of the technical detail of how to do nasty buffer overflow things through binary SMS. It's pretty poor that 10 years on these exploits still exist, I suppose.<br /> <br /> And I do like the conclusion of the article: that making firmware updates straightforward is the answer, as it'll allow vendors to patch such bugs after a handset launch. It's another win for the <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2010/01/some-bets-on-mobile.html">gentle divorce of mobile software from hardware</a>.<br /> <br /> P.S. Yes it has been quiet here. No I haven't stopped thinking.
