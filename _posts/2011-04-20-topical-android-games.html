<p>A hat-trick of posts today. This one's something I've wanted to do for ages; it was something we fancied trying out under the Fat Parrot brand, but have never quite gotten to. I alluded to it in <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2010/10/on-fat-parrots-disposable-games-and-selling-android-apps.html">my post about Fat Parrot</a>, but here's a bit more detail.</p>

<p>The Android marketplace has no approval, and lets you launch games within minutes. One of the things I remember from my computing teacher at secondary school was a quote he was fond of: "<em>bigger problems don't mean bigger solutions, they mean different solutions</em>". Scale brings differences in approach. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">Big O Notation</a> and all that.</p>

<p>So Android's lack of approval doesn't just let you do stuff faster than Apple and Nokia will allow you to, it opens up completely new opportunities. Then consider Wieden & Kennedy doing that <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/how_old_spice_won_the_internet.php">lovely reactive Old Spice stuff</a> on Twitter: you can streamline production of even high-quality content and do it "live".</p>

<p>So imagine taking 5-7 different game formats: sliding tiles, puzzles, "catch a falling object", etc. - and being able and ready to reskin them in response to a news story, every day - and publish them, there and then. So that by 8am you have a few games in the marketplace which are simple enough for anyone to understand, and tied - perhaps amusingly - into something that's only just happened.</p>

<p>My gut is that this would let you see more sales from the effort you put into writing one of these games; that occasionally some of these games would go or be driven viral, and generate disproportionate returns; that the scarcity of deleting old games might even encourage downloads or sales; and that you'd have something which could scale across territories. You'd also get a chance to iterate daily (something few business do right now), learn what works and what doesn't, and get better, day in, day out.</p>

<p>6 game formats, daily launches, earning Â£50 each day in 5 territories doesn't feel unachievable and is about half a million a year in revenue.</p>

<p>Maybe one day...</p>
