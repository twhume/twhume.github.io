<p>We've spent the last couple of months working on a project for the BBC Radio 1 Big Weekend. Richard Morland of the BBC has written a lovely write-up of it all <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio/2011/05/im_here_now_bbcs_first_locatio.html">over here</a>; it's a little experiment to explore how real people feel about privacy issues around event check-ins.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to seeing his follow-up post discussing how it all went...</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Mr Falletti has <a href="http://sergiofalletti.typepad.com/sergio/2011/05/creating-the-check-in-app-for-radio-1s-big-weekend.html">gone into more detail on the project</a> over at his blog. Oh, and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2011/05/radio_1_big_weekend_check-in_e.html">more from the BBC here</a>.</p>
