<p>I really like this post about "<a href="http://skilldrick.co.uk/2011/05/the-end-of-progressive-enhancement-revisited/">the end of progressive enhancement</a>", because it draws a distinction I've been looking for for a while - between web-as-media and web-as-technology-stack.</p>

<p>I've been having some trouble, sitting here in mobile-land, with the idea that a native operating system should run a web browser, JavaScript framework, and application JavaScript atop one another in order to emulate the native operating system. The whole notion seems inelegant (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, plus your server-side gubbins to emulate native apps which could be written in Java, Objective-C, etc) and inefficient; and efficiency matters more when you're battery-powered.</p>

<p>So I like the idea that my scepticism over "web as technology stack for delivering native-looking apps" and enthusiasm for "web as medium" can be reconciled :)<br />
