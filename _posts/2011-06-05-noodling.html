<p>I was feeling a bit twitchy about not having written any code for a while, and I wanted to fiddle with the <a href="http://www.songkick.com/developer/">Songkick API</a>. On discovering that there didn't seem to be any Java libraries for it, I thought I'd write one. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/songkick-java-api/">Here it is</a>; it's quite limited at the moment (only does Event, Artist and Location searches), but I'm adding to it every now and then and maybe you'll find it useful.</p>
