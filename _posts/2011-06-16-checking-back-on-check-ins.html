<p>Via <a href="http://sergiofalletti.typepad.com/sergio/2011/06/radio1-big-weekend-retrospective.html">Mr Falletti</a>, I notice that the BBC have <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio/2011/06/radio_1s_big_weekend_explorati.html">posted a review</a> of the Facebook check-in project we ran for them at the Radio 1 Big Weekend, including a load of video footage with attendees. As he says, it's very frank and complete:</p>

<blockquote>
"<i>Even though we had some initial teething issues, the research from the audience and on site analytics showed that the audience really liked sharing their unique experience with (or bragging to) their friends.

<p>We had large interaction spike from the news story posts from seeing a high number of 'likes' and 'comments' on each of the check ins. This interaction was exactly what we were trying to achieve and it really worked. Interestingly, the stats also showed that more women engaged with the product rather than men - something that needs to be investigated further - does social syndication in this way appeal more to women than men?</i>"<br />
