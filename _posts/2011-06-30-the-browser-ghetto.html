<p><a href="http://designmind.frogdesign.com/blog/design-communism.html">Design Communism</a>: "<i>The Browser Ghetto is effectively a subpar OS with itâ€™s own incompatible user conventions. What is needed is a deep integration of mobile technologies into the OS of a phone, done in a way that works across multiple platforms. This is where my design communism comes into play. Both Apple and Google seem unlikely to consider this. Their fear is that doing so would cede much of their app market away, turning their handsets into commodities. A naive form of capitalism dictates that they keep control and not embrace any approach that gives away their lock in.</i>"</p>
