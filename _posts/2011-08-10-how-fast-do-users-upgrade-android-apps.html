<p>Alex Craxton <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/AlexCraxton/status/101245613877891072">asked a question on Twitter</a>, around how quickly users do or don't upgrade their applications. Quick as a flash, <a href="http://hugman.posterous.com/">Mr Hugman</a> had dug out the relevant graphs from our analytics of <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.futureplatforms.android.guardian">The Guardian Anywhere</a>. The following two graphs show the transition between two minor versions of the product - from 2.15 to 2.17 (2.16 was a very short-lived version we rolled out a bug fix for):</p>

<p>Ramp-down from 2.15:</p>

<p>Ramp-up from 2.17:</p>

<p>They're plotting the number of synchronisations we've had from each version, per day. We typically see one sync per active user per day.</p>

<p>The Guardian Anywhere currently has 36,440 users with active installations; given that by the 8th August we had 29,745 syncs from version 2.17, <strong>this equates to 81% of our audience upgrading to the latest version within 5 weeks of launch</strong>. Hope that helps, Alex!</p>
