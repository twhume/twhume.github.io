<p>"<em>How long before iChat (notably missing from the iPhone to date) starts to compete with SMS?</em>", <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2010/06/apple-and-facetime.html">I asked</a>. 16 months, it turns out.</p>

<p>My completely atypical mobile-geek multiple-device-owning lifestyle has thrown an abnormal amount of light onto <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/features.html#imessage">iMessage</a>, which is clearly Apple starting to replace text messaging in a characteristically subtle way. I'm actually <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2011/07/samsung.html">using a Galaxy S2</a> day-to-day, but I have an iPhone 4 kicking about which I upgraded to iOS 5 the other day. As part of the upgrade process, I had to insert my SIM card, and it appears that during the process Apple recorded my mobile number and associated it with that device.</p>

<p>The upshot is that anyone sending me a message from their iOS 5 device now punts me (without realising it) an iMessage rather than the SMS they would previously sent. iOS seems to detect if you're sending a message to someone else Apple thinks owns an iOS device, and does this automagically. They also  downplay the fact that this is going on; the only reason I'm noticing this is that the iMessage goes to the iPhone which sits at my bedside being The Worlds Most Pretentious Alarm Clock, and my iPhone-owning friends think I've stopped talking to them.</p>

<p>It appears that you can't choose to send a text message, but have to deactivate iMessage completely in your settings to get around this. I'm actually a little impressed by how Apple are doing it: it's entirely possible to not notice that they've replaced a core part of mobile communications. It's a little annoying in my case, but I can see that asking  which of umpteen different ways (SMS, MMS, Email, etc) I'd like to send a given contact a message, every time I message them, would just be irritatingâ€¦ and, I note, exactly the kind of thing most other device manufacturers have done for years.</p>
