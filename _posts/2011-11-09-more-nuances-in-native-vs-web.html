<p>I'm collecting signs of people looking at things a little bit differently, when it comes to building mobile apps (mindful, of course, of <a href="https://github.com/KirinJS">Kirin</a>, <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">our</a> approach for this). Here's a few I've come across:</p>

<ul>
<li> TheNextWeb, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2011/11/02/gmails-ios-app-5-features-wed-like-to-see-in-the-update/">commenting on the launch</a> (and subsequent withdrawal) of the GMail app for iPhone/iPad: "<i>…some people pointed out that although Gmail’s app uses web view, it’s wrapped in a native wrapper – effectively giving us the worst of both worlds.</i>"
<li> Matt Asay of Strobe (just acquired by Facebook) <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/10/26/html5_and_the_enterprise/">writing in The Register</a>, talks about how HTML5-for-apps is playing much better in the enterprise, where traditionally user experience has been seen as less important: "<i>And while HTML5 still struggles to deliver as slick an experience as native app development with Java (Android) or Objective-C (iOS), this isn't much of a factor behind the firewall. Enterprise IT is mostly concerned with delivering a good enough user experience on a cross-platform basis.</i>"
<li> Sticking with Facebook, ReadWriteWeb <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/mobile/2011/09/how-facebook-mobile-was-designp3.php">posted an insight</a> into their approach to mobile apps: "<i>instead of the phone saying I am rendering for a WebKit browser, we send an agent that says you are going to be rendering for a WebKit UI WebKit view inside the iPhone app. So, what you have to do is detect that, style a Web code to make that work, build a bridge between the things that you want to write to interact natively with the Objective-C, say in Javascript, then build HTML pages for Facebok in the iPhone. So, you build much smaller native goop instead of having to build over and over again.</i>". 
</ul>
