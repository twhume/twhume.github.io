<p>It's been a while since I posted a link-dump, so here's a few that have popped up on my radar recently:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/">A brief rant on the future of interaction design</a>: "<i>I call this technology Pictures Under Glass. Pictures Under Glass sacrifice all the tactile richness of working with our hands, offering instead a hokey visual facade.</i>";
<li> <a href="http://blog.pinboard.in/2011/11/the_social_graph_is_neither/">The social graph is neither</a>: "<i>â€¦we have seen the Web, and we have tasted of the blogroll and the lolcat and found that they were good</i>";
<li> <a href="http://www.journalism.org/analysis_report/tablet?src=prc-headline">How people use tablets and what it means for the future of news</a>: "<i> A plurality of tablet news users (40%) say they get their news mainly through a web browser. Another 31% use news apps and the browser equally, while fewer, 21%, get their news primarily through app</i>"
</ul>
