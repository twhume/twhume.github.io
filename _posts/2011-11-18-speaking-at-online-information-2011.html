<p>In a couple of weeks time I'm going to be speaking at <a href="http://admin.miramedia.co.uk/online2011/">Online Information 2011</a>; I'll be presenting some tips for mobile success, based on what we've learned launching mobile products at FP. It's an interesting looking event, spanning librarianship, Internet and mobile - and a nice mix of industry and academia as a result. I'm planning to talk about some of the less shiny, but no less important, aspects of mobile.</p>

<p>I'm speaking as part of the "Going Mobile" session on day 2, alongside Steve Wing of the Guardian and the ever-present Chris Book.</p>

<p>If you're interested in other places to catch folks from <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">FP</a> and <a href="http://www.vexeddigital.com/">Vexed</a>, there's a helpful list you can check out <a href="http://www.vexeddigital.com/news/vexed-upcoming-conferences-2/">here</a>. And if you're at <a href="http://droidcon.in/2011/">Droidcon India</a> today, run, now, towards the talk <a href="http://hugman.posterous.com/">James Hugman</a> is giving on <a href="https://github.com/KirinJS">Kirin</a>.</p>
