<p>A last minute booking: I shall be doing a panel session at the fascinating-looking <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/conference/Amsterdam-2011/program">Quantified Self European Conference</a> this weekend, in Amsterdam.</p>

<p>Looks to be a great event, and I've been getting steadily more interested in this stuff since <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/twh/capitalising-on-popular-culture">this talk</a> I researched and gave back in 2009.</p>
