<p>The alarm clock is a standard feature of mobile phones, and an incredibly popular one. More people use the alarm clock of their phone daily than send text messages or browse the mobile Internet; by this measure <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/mobile_phone_usage_survey-review-592p3.php">it's the most used feature of a phone</a>, bar making calls. And yet of all the functions in your phone, the alarm clock is one of the most staid - unaffected by advances in technology, connectivity or our behaviour. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/6504666559/" title="Samsung Galaxy S2 Alarm clock by twhume, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7154/6504666559_8b907a825f_m.jpg" width="95" height="240" alt="Samsung Galaxy S2 Alarm clock" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5"></a>I've been looking at the alarm clock that shipped with my Samsung Galaxy S2. It feels over-complicated to an intimidating degree: separate options for Alarm type and Alarm tone, a selection of possible snooze settings, something called "Smart Alarm" which sits there on-screen bereft of explanation, and the ability to give your alarm a name. 9 input fields, just to say "wake me up"? This can be improved.</p>

<p>I've been thinking for a while that there's some interesting work to be done here, so I'm using a piece of coursework for <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/study/pg/2011/taught/1572/23959">my MSc</a> to have a look at alarm clocks, from an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction">HCI</a> perspective. To kick this off I'm doing some research into how real people (that's you) use their alarm clocks, and how they manage their sleep-time. So I'd be awfully grateful if you could take a few minutes (literally) to fill out <a href="http://bit.ly/sleep_survey">this survey</a> on the subject. </p>

<p>This will be a design project (rather than a research or evaluation piece): I'm going to produce at least a couple of iterations of design for an improved piece of alarm clock software. Now, I've always admired what I've read of Pixar and their process of doing <a href="http://hbr.org/2008/09/how-pixar-fosters-collective-creativity/ar/1">daily design critiques</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<i>"At Pixar, daily animation work is shown in an incomplete state to the whole crew. This process helps people get over any embarrassment about sharing unfinished workâ€”so they become even more creative. It enables creative leads to communicate important points to the entire crew at once"</i>
</blockquote>

<p>What I'm working on now is a solo project which won't naturally give me many options to get feedback, and there's no need for me to communicate aspects of the design to a wider group; but I'm still interested in understanding what it feels like to work in that Pixar fashion, and how it could improve the end product.</p>

<p>So I'm going to post regular updates of unfinished work here and invite comment; I think my readership is small enough that I know most of you, and I think you'll have some interesting opinions. And if you've read this far, please do pop over to <a href="http://bit.ly/sleep_survey">that survey</a> - it'll give the work I'm doing some grounding in reality.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: 3:25pm on Wednesday 14th December 2011, I'm marking the survey as no longer accepting responses now, after 24 hours. Thank you *very* much to every single one of the 187 people who kindly gave up a few minutes to help with this.</p>
