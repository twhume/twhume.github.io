<p>So, today… I <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2011/12/alarm-clock-first-sketches.html">wrote up the sketching from last night</a>, and would still love comments from anyone who can spare the time to look through them. In particular I'd like to hear feedback on the detail of it all.</p>

<p>I spent a few hours this afternoon putting together a card-and-paper model of some of the sketches; something which I can put in front of real people next week to test the ideas. I'm not sure how well this is working:  maybe I just need a few more screens in there before it'll start to feel worthwhile. I'm worried that some of the interactions I have in mind (e.g. 2-finger pinches) in some spots will be quite tough to model in paper, too. Let's see.</p>

<div align="center">
<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash"  width="400" height="225" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"> <param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&photo_secret=7ca0e86bd4&photo_id=6521785889"></param> <param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786"></param> <param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"></param> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&photo_secret=7ca0e86bd4&photo_id=6521785889" height="225" width="400"></embed></object>
</div>

<p>I've also been thinking about the visibility of analogue displays (after getting a bit worried that I'd prematurely rejected the idea of a digital one), and did a little test - taking photos of analogue and digital using my camera phone, from the bedside and end of the bed. Here they are:</p>

<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/6521923705/" title="Digital display, from the bed by twhume, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7012/6521923705_7cdf855b2f_t.jpg" width="100" height="75" alt="Digital display, from the bed"></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/6521921719/" title="Analogue display, from the bed by twhume, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7148/6521921719_50273af0f2_t.jpg" width="100" height="75" alt="Analogue display, from the bed"></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/6521922465/" title="Digital display, from far end of bed by twhume, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7155/6521922465_4d58dfdc00_t.jpg" width="100" height="75" alt="Digital display, from far end of bed"></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/6521920491/" title="Analogue display, from far end of bed by twhume, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7167/6521920491_8033c40bcc_t.jpg" width="100" height="75" alt="Analogue display, from far end of bed"></a>
</div>

<p>I can't see a bit difference in readability, myself. And I think there's more room for improvement in the analogue clock than in the digital one - in that the white circle around the clock-face distracts from the lettering, and could be made less prominent. So I'm a little bit less worried about going analogue for the UI now…<br />
