<li> Ben Evans on <a href="http://www.ben-evans.com/post/14858334056/facebooks-300m-app-users">Facebook and their 300m app users</a>: "<i>70% of mobile users and 30% of all users used apps to access Facebook</i>". Completely in line with the figures we heard from Simon at Comscore in a Mobile Monday talk in July: UK web traffic to Facebook was growing slowly and app traffic to Facebook much faster. Projecting forward at the time it looked like apps would overtake web in September 2011;
<li> Retail has problems this year, can't say I think that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/26/the-threat-and-opportunity-of-mobile-how-physical-retailers-can-use-personalization-and-data-to-fight-back-against-amazon/">coupons, virtual currencies, and shopper heat maps alone</a> will be enough to save the high street. I found this concept from PayPal beautiful though: <a href="http://thenextweb.com/video/2011/12/13/paypals-impressive-demo-brings-window-shopping-to-your-phone-literally-video/">use shop windows</a> even when the shops are shut. Helen has a nice thread going about this <a href="http://www.technokitten.blogspot.com/2011/12/2012-is-year-when-traditional-retail.html">over at her blog</a>. I think we'll see some really interesting work done here over the next few years as retail is caught between technology advances and economic troubles and has to adapt;
<li> I hope Project Spartan launches this year. It was due to launch "<i>in the next few weeks</i>" <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/15/facebook-project-spartan/">back in July</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/28/this-sure-looks-a-lot-like-facebooks-project-spartan-screenshots/">then in September</a>, and it'd be nice to have the (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/24/the-decline-and-fall-of-the-appian-empires/">mostly baseless</a>) speculation of how it's going to change everything laid to rest; 
<li> There's <a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2011/12/23/the-galaxy-s-not-getting-ics-isnt-a-samsung-problem-its-an-android-problem/">lots of talk</a> of how lack of OS updates is a flaw in the Android ecosystem, I prefer the explanation that <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/why-android-updates-are-a-mess-its-the-business-model/4300">it's down to economic incentives</a>: once they've sold you a handset, networks or device manufacturers have no ongoing revenue from you, so find it hard to justify ongoing effort on your device. Apple aside, device manufacturers don't tend to do a great job of services which provide this kind of ongoing revenue - Ovi is the most successful I can think of - so I like the idea of <a href="http://www.phonedog.com/2011/12/27/would-you-be-willing-to-pay-for-your-android-update/">end-users paying for upgrades</a>: a few pounds for a significant update to your phone doesn't seem unreasonable to me.
<li> A beautiful set of criticisms of Android 4.0 UI, in <a href="http://icspapercuts.tumblr.com/">ICS paper cuts</a>. Much more constructive than the "Google don't get design!" drivel;
<li> <a href="http://www.theequitykicker.com/2011/12/22/the-web-is-may-not-prevail/">The web may not prevail</a>, a post from Nick Brisbourne building on <a href="http://joehewitt.com/2011/09/26/what-the-web-is-and-is-not">What the web is and is not</a> from Joe Hewitt: "<i>even though the open web is better, it wonâ€™t necessarily prevail</i>". I wonder how long it will take for the traditional net.infrastructure to be sidelined - not long if you believe <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/17/this-is-not-the-net-you-thought-you-knew/">this post</a>: "<i>The Classic Web is beginning to look like a kludge. Mostly because it was</i>"
<li> Nice to see a couple of deeply constrained social networks pop up to handle social networks of two: <a href="http://appbetween.us/">Between</a> and <a href="http://cupple.mobi/">Cupple</a> are both for intimate 2-person sharing. Lovely use case (though I've yet to see Between actually work), and I wonder if buddy-systems might be useful in other situations: could we usefully deploy 2-person social networks for folks trying to give up smoking, lose weight, or otherwise improve their behaviour not in public, but with the support of a friend?
