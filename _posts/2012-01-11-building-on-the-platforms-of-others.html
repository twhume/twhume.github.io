<p>If you <a href="http://twitter.com/twhume">follow me on Twitter </a>then every so often you'll see a tweet crowing about some figure or other behind the <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.futureplatforms.android.guardian&hl=en">Guardian Anywhere</a> news-reading application we launched at FP. For instance,  last month we distributed our 5 millionth copy of the Guardian.</p>

<p>The Guardian Anywhere has been available for well over 2 years now, and we've depended on the goodwill of the Guardian in allowing us to use their RSS feeds, their <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform">Open Platform</a> and even some branding in our product. Even though they've launched <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.guardian">their own official Android app</a>, we haven't been quietly asked to remove ours - which is to their credit, given that there's no contract or other agreement covering this between <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">Future Platforms</a> and them.</p>

<p>Over the last few years there have been a few cases of third parties building on top of a platform, only for the platform provider themselves to launch a competing product or start restricting third-party provision of interfaces; Twitter is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/11/twitter-ecosystem-guidelines/">an obvious example</a>.</p>

<p>There are compelling reasons for platform providers to do this, both commercial (keeping control of revenue opportunities) and customer-focused (ensuring that the end-user experience of your platform is one you're happy with). At FP we picked up a couple of projects for very large businesses that were unhappy with third parties owning the experience of their product, and wanted to do it themselves (OK, with our help). </p>

<p>So I thought it might be interesting to show the impact of the Guardian launching their official Android product on the stats for the Guardian Anywhere. Here's a nice graph showing our sync traffic over the last couple of years (a sync being a device connecting in to download a copy of the newspaper; most users do this once a day):</p>

<p>You can clearly see our traffic peak when the official product launched, but I'm surprised the subsequent decline wasn't greater. At the time I expected us to see the majority of our traffic drop off in a few months. Of course, it looks better than it is, because we would expect traffic to grow during this period. If you consider that (and take a mid-point projection of growth, at a rate somewhere between the huge take-up May-August 2010 and the average growth over the last 2 years), then it looks like so far we've lost somewhere between a half and a third of our traffic:</p>

<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twhume/6678725773/" title="Guardian Anywhere traffic, 2009-2012 by twhume, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7028/6678725773_4a07df5157.jpg" width="500" height="138" alt="Guardian Anywhere traffic, 2009-2012"></a></div>

<p>So it's slow decline, rather than immediate shut-down. I wonder if this is a familiar pattern to other folks who've found themselves competing with the platform they built atop?</p>
