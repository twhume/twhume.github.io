<p>If you happen to be in Worthing on February 28th, I'll be reprising my <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/twh/making-sense-of-sensors-9374767">Making Sense of Sensors</a> talk from <a href="http://future-of-mobile.com/">Future of Mobile 2011</a>; possibly with some updates courtesy of the Master's and some reading I've been doing around the topic since. More details <a href="http://www.freshegg.com/training-events/">here</a>.</p>
