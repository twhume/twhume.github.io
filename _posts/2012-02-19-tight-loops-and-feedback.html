<p>One of the interesting, and frustrating things about the course I'm doing in Adaptive Systems is its generality; being quite cybernetic, it can be applied or observed in many contexts (biology, robotics, environmental, organisational), and it's down to us to develop our own idea of what it means. </p>

<p>What this means is that I've been reading a few papers on robotics, and in particular developed a taste for the work of <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/">Rodney Brooks</a>. At a time when the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOFAI">GOFAI</a> crowd were obsessed with symbolic approaches with AI, he was rolling up his sleeves and encouraging his group at MIT to build stuff in the real world.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&AD=ADA220016">Battling Reality</a> is one of my favourite papers so far, for its frankness ("<em>Many of the preconceived notions entertained before we started building our robots turned out to be misguided</em>"), and its clear message that the act of construction was in itself educational. In particular,</p>

<blockquote>
<i>"Unless you  design,  build,  experiment  and  test in  the real  world  in  a tight loop,  you  can  spend  a lot  of time on  the wrong  problems"</i></blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<i>"Understanding  the  environment  and truly discovering  the constraints on  cognition are more readily  done by building  one robot  than  by  thinking grand  thoughts for a long  time."</i></blockquote>

<p>…which set a few agile/lean bells ringing for me (including the one marked "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a>", of course).</p>

<p>There's also an air of <a href="http://www.kevinwarwick.com/">Warwick</a>-style showmanship to someone who authors a paper titled <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/papers/fast-cheap.pdf">Fast, cheap and out of control: a robot invasion of the solar system</a>, too…</p>
