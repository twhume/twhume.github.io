<p>A couple of weeks back I <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2012/02/designing-for-complex-systems-with-the-pope.html">posted</a> about how we might design for systems which we can't understand the inner workings of.</p>

<p>I ended up chatting about this to a neighbour over fondue at <a href="http://liftconference.com/lift12">LIFT</a> last week, and in the course of this it occurred to me that this isn't just a design problem, it's also a societal one.</p>

<p>The analogy I came up with (which my neighbour felt was a poor one, it has to be said) was the car: if you'd shown a car to someone in medieval times, they might have found the absence of a horse pulling it to be deeply disturbing. In much the same way, we expect to be able to understand what happens inside the software which we spend ever-larger chunks of our lives conversing with. </p>

<p>So if we fear technologies we don't or can't understand,  we need to find ways to move beyond this fear.</p>

<p>If you're interested in this, <a href="http://liftconference.com/lift12/program/talk/ben-bashford-use-artificial-emotion-and-empathy-digital-products">Ben Bashford did a nice talk</a> which is worth checking out.</p>
