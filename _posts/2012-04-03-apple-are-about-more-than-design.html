<p> There's a meme that's floated around for a few years now without being challenged, and it's that the success of Apple is explained by their focus on design, in particular through the work of a couple of in-house geniuses. The idea that their success is explained by the individual genius of Ive and Jobs is a convenient myth for them to encourage, but I don't think it's the whole story. And they don't think so either: witness the efforts to systematise their success by setting up an internal university, or Tim Cook's assertion that <a href="http://busk.com/news/apples-cook-aims-to-reassure-wall-street-on-apples-future-mobilized">they don't share details of their process because it's part of their competitive advantage</a></p>

<p>Rather, what makes them scary, and probably fun, to compete with is that they do very well at very many things. Design is a part of this, but their software quality is good relative to their peers: witness the flood of developers moving from Windows to BSD-based MacOS in the early 2000s. They have done incredible things logistically (there's a good tale in the Jobs biography about their buying up capacity on air freight to get iPods delivered, I think). Their marketing is clear and consistent. And so on.</p>

<p>I don't mean to eulogise them here. Not everything they touch turns to gold (just look at Ping, or iAd) and I find the regulations and control around the App Store a little hard to stomach; they feel like they lead to a slightly cloying Disney-like experience sometimes. But the idea that to succeed like Apple, you just need to "get design" and have a few solitary geniuses? It's inaccurate and naive.</p>
