<p>When I first started blogging, I used a quite esoteric product (for which I developed a great fondness) called <a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio Userland</a>. I can't remember why I stopped using it, but at the time I found myself jotting down lots of short-form thoughts. My style of writing was very different to the longer pieces I do nowadays, and in part I put this down to the lurking "Title" field that <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">TypePad</a> includes: it suggests a formality to individual posts.</p>

<p>But I quite miss being able to throw out any old idea. The conciseness of Twitter makes it great fun, but it's an awkward place to carry out conversations and sometimes I want a little more than 140 charactersâ€¦ so I'm going to start putting shorter-form stuff over on <a href="https://plus.google.com/102507218741394955756/posts">my Google+ stream</a>. I'm also cross-posting longer stuff there, to see how that works too.</p>
