<p>More on alarm clocks... the DoubleTwist guys have done <a href="http://blog.doubletwist.com/2012/03/30/doubletwist-alarm-clock-wake-up-to-your-music/">this beautiful app</a>. It looks wonderful - extremely clean and simple. I upgraded to ICS today so will spend a little time in Android-land, using it. And there's a great interview with the designer <a href="http://design.org/blog/interview-doubletwist-alarm-ui-designer-sebastiaan-de">here</a>.</p>

<p>I quite liked his perspective that as a designer, Android was a fun place to be because it's where most work is needed. I don't get why more people don't feel this way.</p>

<p>I thought <a href="http://www.springwise.com/marketing_advertising/alarm-clock-app-rewards-users-guessing-citys-sounds-wake/">this one</a> was cute, too; Lufthansa producing an alarm clock which wakes you to the sound of different cities :)<br />
