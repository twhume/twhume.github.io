<p>I'm absolutely loving some of <a href="http://www.90percentofeverything.com/">Harry Brignull's</a> recent posts: clear, authentic writing, drawing on experiences from real projects. Why don't more people write like this?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.90percentofeverything.com/2012/04/20/from-print-to-ipad-designing-a-reading-experience/">Pop over to this one</a>, which talks about the design process for the iPad edition of The Week:</p>

<blockquote>
<i>"It tanked bigtime. Suddenly I realised that usability testing is only fun when it rips apart someone else’s work! When you’ve spent weeks selling the idea to your client’s stakeholders, it’s pretty depressing.

<p>Looking back on it, we made the classic architect’s mistake of designing for a fictitious user behaviour that only existed in our heads."</i><br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>I think there's still a tradition of businesses not admitting to their mistakes; maybe there's a fear around legal liability or admissions of negligence underpinning this, maybe it's ego.</p>

<p>I felt I had to pretend everything was perfect during the early years of FP, and I like the fact that this is changing: that organisations like <a href="http://www.hub100.org/">MDHub</a> exist to let business owners  discuss failures and problems with each other behind closed doors; that some people and companies openly take a philosophy that "<em>if you're not failing occasionally, you're playing it too safe</em>"; and that there's even <a href="http://thefailcon.com/">a conference where failure stories are showcased</a> for us all to learn from. More of this, please.</p>

<p>(Oh, and whilst I have your attention here's another tasty treat, via Alex G: <a href="http://www.laboiteverte.fr/les-ancetres-du-gps/">the ancestors of GPS</a>).</p>
