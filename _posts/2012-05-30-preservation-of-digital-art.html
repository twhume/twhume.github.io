<p><a href="http://www.imperica.com/viewsreviews/on-the-preservation-of-digital-art">Nice article</a> from <a href="http://www.bigfug.com/">Alex May</a> on approaches to ensuring the longevity of digital art (and code in general): <em>"As a digital artist, I now try to write code that should last for a hundred years or more. I don't think of it as egotistical. I see it as a technical challenge."</em></p>
