<p>It's no secret that Amazon is shaking up the publishing industry. I've been watching <a href="http://diariesofamodernmadman.blogspot.co.uk/">a friend</a> go through some interesting experiences with self-publishing recently, and he's given some figures and permission to write about it.</p>

<p>Paul's been writing (mainly crime) fiction for a little whole now, drawing on his experiences as a police officer in Brighton, and his slightly diseased imagination. After quite a long process of talking to traditional publishers about <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B007M8CHH2/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=paugrzsthrand-21&camp=1406&creative=6394&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=B007M8CHH2&adid=0YHDSJ17HV4MKBA8FW49&&ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Fdiariesofamodernmadman.blogspot.co.uk%2F">The Follow</a>, a novel about heroin dealers in Brighton, <a href="http://diariesofamodernmadman.blogspot.co.uk/2011/11/to-e-or-not-to-e.html">he decided in November last year</a> to start publishing digitally. There's still a bit of a stigma associated with this sort of thing - I think that an important part of a traditional book deal is the validation of a large publisher saying "we think this is good" - but with the novel sitting unpublished for a little while, why not?</p>

<p>He hooked up with <a href="http://www.trestlepresspublishing.com/">Trestle Press</a> and put it onto Amazon at a quite low price point of £3.69. By mid-February, he was selling a couple of copies a day.</p>

<p>In March, he dropped the price to £1.99 after taking The Follow back from Trestle, and publishing himself. Sales hovered at between 10 and 18 a week.</p>

<p>In May, Paul decided to stop promoting The Follow and see what he could publish next, but noticed that he could make it free for 5 days using <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/self-publishing/KDPSelect">KDP Select</a>; he flicked the switch to see what would happen, and saw 3000 downloads in the first day: both a boost for the ego and not a bad promotional device: "<em>Now thousands of people were reading my book, and it hit number 2 in the free Kindle chart.</em>"</p>

<p>Sales crept upwards after that. The next day he was the 400-or-so most published book on Kindle, and had sold 30 copies; the day after that he was ranked at 250; and a week after the promotion he'd sold 400 copies and was sitting outside the Kindle top 100 (and in the top 10 of the "procedurals" section, which I think is police fiction); sales at this point were about ten a day.</p>

<p>Reviews seem to have a direct impact on sales: after a negative review sales dip slightly, then increase again once a positive one comes through (perhaps the "most recent review" holds a lot of power).</p>

<p>Things I've noticed, watching Paul go through this journey:</p>

<ul>
<li> Most people I know who write do it for love, and to reach an audience. Digital publishing seems to offer both this, and the promise of some sort of return.
<li> I'm sure that a  publisher knows how to market and distribute books better than the average author; but when the alternative is to not be published at all, digital self-publishing looks attractive.
<li> A promotion can build sales traffic, but it drops off shortly afterwards.
<li> The direct relationship between quality of reviews and sales.
</ul>
