<p>I enjoyed reading this little piece that did the rounds last week, about the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/06/22/wacky_power_stats/">costs of power consumption</a> for the iPad ($1.61 annually, if you can't be bothered to click). One thing I've always liked about working in mobile software is the way that environmental concerns line up rather nicely with end-user benefits, when it comes to power: you work hard to minimise your use of it. It's good to see this sort of thing quantified, though I have a feeling the disposability and upgrade cycle for devices pushes the overall environmental footprint of these things back in the wrong direction...<br />
