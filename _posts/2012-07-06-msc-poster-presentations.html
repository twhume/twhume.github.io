<p>If anyone's interested and around Sussex University campus next Friday, I'll be taking part on the <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/ei/internal/forstudents/informatics/masters/dissertations/posterpresentation">Postgraduate Poster Presentations</a> in two capacities: I'm still technically on the Informatics Industry Liaison Board, and I'll be participating as a student this year. Hopefully this will involve a double helping of sandwiches.<br />
