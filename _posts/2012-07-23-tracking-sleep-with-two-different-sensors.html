<p>I've been following the <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/">Quantified Self</a> for a little while now, ever since <a href="http://colinhayhurst.wordpress.com/">Colin Hayhurst</a> first mentioned them to me; and Kate has a similar enthusiasm for the quantitative, so we've both been tracking aspects of ourselves: between us weight (<a href="http://www.withings.com/">Withings</a>), diet (manually), sleep (<a href="http://myzeo.co.uk/">Zeo</a>), and exercise (<a href="http://runkeeper.com/">Runkeeper</a>, <a href="http://fitbit.com/">Fitbit</a>).</p>

<p>One of the modules of my Master's this year was Pervasive Computing, in which we spent a great deal of time looking at sensors and the real-world difficulties of extracting useful information from them. I did a project looking at LEDs, light sensors and morse code which I wrote about briefly <a href="http://www.tomhume.org/2012/01/getting-to-grips-with-properties-of-sensors.html">here</a> (and will post the full text of, once the course is over).</p>

<p>One key lesson from this was the difficulties of ensuring consistent useful results from different sensors; so when I noticed that Fitbit offers to track your sleep patterns, and Kate's Zeo did the same, I thought it'd be interesting to compare the results one gets from each. Fitbit straps to your wrist and detects hand movement, inferring sleep from a lack of such movement; Zeo monitors brain waves.</p>

<p>So a few nights ago I strapped both to myself and managed nonetheless to drift off. Here's what the Fitbit told me about my night:</p>

<p>Here's the Zeo for the same time period:</p>

<p>I was quite surprised at how close they both were. Here's the two graphs scaled to an equivalent size and superimposed:</p>

<p>This seems to suggest that I'm twitching physically not just when I wake up, but when I move between different types of sleepâ€¦</p>

<p>As a result of this, I'm much more confident in both products, as they seem to be measuring something consistently using two completely different methods; which, funnily enough, is an approach which my course tutor <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/172352">Dan Chalmers</a> covered in his pervasive computing textbook...</p>
