<p>Have you seen <a href="http://shop.greengoose.com/">Green Goose</a>? They're doing some beautiful stuff with sensors for consumers: turning everyday activities into games. I love the mundanity of it all: keeping the toilet seat up, brushing your teeth, walking the dog. One of their apps is called "BrushMonkey". It doesn't get any better than this.</p>

<p>They've been around for a little while - there's <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/green_goose_save_money_using_sensors.php">a story on RWW</a> about them from early 2010, but they seem to have changed tack since then, away from financial monitoring and towards fun'n'games. Here's <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/12/stickers-as-sensors.html">an interview with their founder</a> from December last year. Green Goose seem to be spreading themselves thinly across many applications: "<i>Weâ€™ve got about 50 or so other sensors in development right now that we will fairly quickly release over time</i>".</p>

<p>Their hardware seems similar to <a href="http://bergcloud.com/littleprinter/">Little Printer</a>, in that they have their own gateway (the "station egg") which plugs into the spare port of a hub. </p>
