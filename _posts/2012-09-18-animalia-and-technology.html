<p>In the animalia-and-tech link-pile today, an <a href="http://www.springwise.com/health_wellbeing/iphone-case-acts-ecg-device-pets/">iPhone case which acts as an ECG for pets</a> and <a href="http://www.springwise.com/food_beverage/cow-farmers-updated-cattles-wellbeing-sms/">cows that SMS the farmer</a>. The latter's particularly poignant, as the Sardinian chap who for many years rented FP their offices approached us to build a similar thing for him.</p>

<p>I've just started reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Guilty-Robots-Happy-Dogs-Question/dp/0199219303">Guilty Robots, Happy Dogs</a> after a <a href="http://magicalnihilism.com/2012/09/04/blog-all-dog-eared-unpages-guilty-robots-happy-dogs-the-question-of-alien-minds-by-david-mcfarland/">Jones-post</a>. I'm hoping it's the missing link between puppets, furries, and technology that I've been waiting for. This stuff has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digesting_Duck">history</a>.</p>
