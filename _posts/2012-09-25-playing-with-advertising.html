<p>So, down the right hand side of this page you'll see a block, marked "AdSense". That'll be me playing with advertising; I'm interesting in learning a bit more about how online advertising works from a practical perspective, and I like learning about stuff by doing stuff.</p>

<p>So there'll be a small ad - or it might be a large ad in future, who knows? - running there for a little while at least. I'll be donating all income from it to the <a href="http://www.wwf.org.uk/">WWF</a>, to one or several of their efforts around preserving <a href="https://support.wwf.org.uk/adopt-a-tiger">big</a> <a href="https://support.wwf.org.uk/adopt-a-leopard">cats</a>.</p>
