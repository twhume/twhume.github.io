So it’s been a little while since I posted here - nearly 5 years. I've had very little to say in public, work and life have been a lot of fun, and I've not missed writing.

A lot has changed in that time: I joined Google in London, turned 40, got married, relocated to San Francisco, and at the end of last year our daughter arrived. 

A lot has stayed the same too. When I look at my writing I'm happy to see some continuity with my work at Google. There I ended up tugging on a thread of “user interfaces for local intelligence” which manifested across many products I worked on: [Auto Awesome Movies](https://thenextweb.com/google/2013/10/29/google-photo-editing-tool-auto-awesome-now-creates-stunning-edits-videos/#.tnw_NK0A9dfZ), the Android launcher, [Smart Text Selection](http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/05/17/android-o-feature-spotlight-smart-text-selection-automatically-highlights-right-words-double-tap/), [TensorFlow Lite](https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/17/googles-tensorflow-lite-brings-machine-learning-to-android-devices/), and [Federated Learning](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html) (not an exhaustive list). I’ve particularly enjoyed working with a mix of designers, engineers and researchers.

And to hammer home the point about continuity, my last post here touched on the tortoises of W. Grey Walter; fittingly, in August I’m moving to [X](https://x.company) to work in robotics. More interfaces, more intelligence, a new domain.

This is why I’ve resurrected this site: to get some hands-on experience I’ve been playing at the edges of the [DIY Robocars](http://diyrobocars.com) movement, building a [Donkey](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11IPqZcDcLTd2mtYaR5ONpDxFgL9Y1nMNTDvEarST8Wk/edit#heading=h.2q84tqri6g5) and trying to get it running reliably around [The Panhandle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panhandle_(San_Francisco)), a nearby park. I want somewhere to share what I’m doing; this site will do nicely, thank you.
