My attempt to resurrect this site in 2017 didn’t go very far. I had intended to start writing more about my experiments with the [Donkey](http://docs.donkeycar.com/) car, but they hit a bit of a wall when I started in X and had real work to do there, also parenting. I spent a year in X working for what’s now been revealed as the [Everyday Robot project](https://x.company/projects/everyday-robots/), and then returned to my previous team in Google Research, where I’m still working today.

In the last 3 years I think I resurrected the Donkey car 2 or 3 times, and even managed a short habit of heading to one of the [DeepRacing](https://www.meetup.com/deepracing/) get-togethers on a Saturday, or to [DIY Robocars races](https://www.meetup.com/DIYRobocars/); but it turns out that working full time and then taking half a day out at weekends to go play with cars isn’t totally compatible with Life. After a short attempt to get [a track set up in my attic](https://www.meetup.com/DIYRobocars/) (tl;dr it’s big but needs to be bigger to be useful), I threw in the towel… for now.
