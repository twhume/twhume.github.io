I really enjoyed spending some time last year learning about cognition, and I didn't want it to end there. Plus as we (kinda, sorta) come out of COVID, I wanted to start meeting other human beings - maybe even ones I didn't already know.

After observing that Meetup groups seem to be a wasteland - huge member numbers but no activity in most of them - I've set up the [San Francisco Cognitive Science Reading Group](https://www.meetup.com/san-francisco-cognitive-science-meetup-group/). We have a [first event](https://www.meetup.com/san-francisco-cognitive-science-meetup-group/events/291413888/) in early March, at which we'll discuss [Being You, by Anil Seth](https://www.amazon.com/Being-You-New-Science-Consciousness/dp/1524742872). I'm still working on a venue - it'll be an in-person event, though if we can support remote attendees we will do so.
