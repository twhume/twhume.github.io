You can find my professional and educational background at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/twhume/). tl;dr I work as a Product Manager for [Google DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com). 

I was born in Brighton on the south coast of the UK, and lived there most of my life before moving to San Francisco in 2013; but I'm a Sussex pig at heart, and [wunt be druv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_wunt_be_druv). I live in The City now with my wife, daughter, and one cat.

I'm interested in intelligence (artificial and otherwise), human/machine interfaces, the process of building software, and robotics. In my spare time I practice karate at [Zanshin Dojo](sfgoju.org) (since 2017) and before that I trained in aikido at [Airenjuku Brighton](https://airenjuku.wordpress.com) (1998-2013). I organize a regular reading group for cognitive science in San Francisco, the imaginatively named [San Francisco Cognitive Science Reading Group](https://www.meetup.com/san-francisco-cognitive-science-meetup-group/). I run, cycle, and walk in the woods.
